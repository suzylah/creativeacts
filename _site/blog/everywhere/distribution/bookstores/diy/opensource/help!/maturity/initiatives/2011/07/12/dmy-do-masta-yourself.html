    <p><img alt="" src="/assets/files/u6/MASTA%20in%20Motto.JPG" style="width: 507px; height: 381px; float: left;" /> MASTA is going thru some changes. Look, it's in a bookstore. <strong>Have you ever thought MASTA would end up in places like this?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe MASTA is really applying the theme of it's latest issue: Growth (#7). After #5 <strong>MASTA got independent from motherorganisation <a href="http://www.loesje.org/" target="_blank">Loesje</a></strong> we changed a lot: MASTA got a weblog, recycled paper, different format and a steady team for already 3 issues (#8 is coming).</p>
<p>The biggest change though, is not visible but has the most impact: <strong>instead of spreading the magazine all over the world for free, you know will have to pay for a copy</strong>.</p>
<p>"What is up with that?!", I hear you thinking. But if you take a little time to read further, I'll try to explain. Eventually I'll even tell you <strong>the secret of how to get a copy of MASTA for free</strong>, or at least how to get one without having to pay for it.</p>
<p>Click on '<a href="http://www.mastazine.net/blog/node/47" target="_self">Read more</a>' to find out how MASTA works.</p>
<p><!--break--><strong>The </strong><strong>organisation of MASTA</strong><br />To explain what is going on I'll explain briefly how MASTA is organized: basically it is a group of people that feels responsible for spreading news about and inspiring for subversive creativism thru the magazine we produce. This crew is working voluntary, at least until so far. Depending on what crew you are 'in' but more important, on personal intererst the work consists of <strong>editing; writing; layouting; meeting; networking; organising; organising exchanges and trainings; doing finances; travelling; keeping up the webinfrastructure; keeping contact with interesting initiatives; writing applications and probably some more stuff that I'm forgetting about</strong>. This besides studies and/or a regular job.</p>
<p>To give some clearity about how we work I'll explain a bit about the different crews. First I'd have to say that we don't work in an office in which all employees are clearly separated in departments. Instead <strong>we are spread all over Europe, a bit in the US and Brazil</strong> and hopefully later over the rest of the planet. This includes all contributors, the people that did actions and&nbsp; reported to MASTA. This explains why so much travelling is involved: for every meeting all crewmembers gather at one place in Europe. But besides beeing a very time-consuming effort it is also provides an open view on the world, a great network of (international) contacts and destructs national and cultural boarders.<strong> It's the radical total opposite of the cubicle way of working, fairly inefficient but humanbased which guarantees a steady progress.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The crews</strong></p>
<p>Roughly the MASTA organisation is separated in the organisational crew, the webdevelopement crew, the blog crew, editorial crew and contributors.&nbsp; Starting with the last one, I'll explain shortly what these crews do and how they work together. First: <strong>contributors. The core of MASTA</strong>, we could do wtihout any crews but this one they provide all content. Often contriburors aren't considered to be a crew. Okay, they don't meet but because of their imput it is possible to make MASTA. Than we come to the<strong> editorial crew. They are the main link between the magazine and the contributors</strong>. Editors gather material, meet online and before every new issue in real life. They decide about the topic, what material will be used, how long an article is etc. Contentwise, they decide everything. Than they kneed, cut and adapt the material to fit the magazine. Because not everybody is as good in writing some articles are delivered ready to be published, others need more work. A <strong>special mention has to made about the visual editors</strong>. They are responsible for the layout of MASTA, which we highly value because it's the first thing people notice when seeing the magazine. They do the same as the the other editors do with written articles but with the pictures and illustrations we recieve. These are the teams responcible for the printed version of MASTA.</p>
<p>Since the Stream-it training that was organized in november 2010 in Berlin <strong>we have a weblog, this one</strong>. The people concerned with keeping up the blog only need to make small articles (or long ones, as they like) about things that caught their eye. Working without deadlines or printing costs and the ability to include direct links to sources makes it a great always up-to-date version of the magazine. <strong>The blog-crew always keeps an updated inspirationsource for your subversive creativity</strong>. It's also a great source for content for the printed magazine. Overal, people in the blog crew consist of people from all other crews and others.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/files/u6/P7120142.JPG" style="width: 233px; height: 175px; float: right;" />Last but not least, there are two crews that are never seen but provide the preconditions for all others. That is, first of all, <strong>the webdevelopement team, I call them nerds but that's because I'm jealous of their capabilities</strong>. They designed and keep up all web-infrastructure that we are so dependent on to communicate over these distances. And where do you think this blog and the rest of the website comes from? Besides that they provide sufficient answers and explainations from digital retards like myself, they come up with the most amazing idea's and examples of internet-activism. The webdevelopers have something to do with all other crews, in a supporting role. All activities, having a webdomain, printing the magazines, travelling for meetings, organising trainings and exchanges cost money, in other words:<strong> MASTA has it's economical obligations. This is the part that is taken care of by the organisational crew</strong>. These people work to arrange the official parts that involve making a transmedial magazine: registering as an organisation, getting a bankaccount, writing applications and so nowadays also finding distribution-networks such as bookstores etc. The organisational crew is responsible to provide the preconditions in order for all other crews to be able to work.</p>
<p><strong>Why to buy</strong> <strong>and why we sell</strong></p>
<p>When MASTA was still part of Loesje it was part of an established organisation with it's resources and finance-network. This made it able for MASTA to be spread to anyone who asked over the world for free. <strong>When we became independent we lost all these resources</strong>, we even lost our official status as an organisation enabeling us apply for fundings at the European Union or get a bankaccount to recieve donations or gather funds from crowd funding. While that is slowly but steady taken care of we still need income to be able to produce the next issue. There is a simple reasoen for that: we have none.</p>
<p>T<strong>he only capital we currently have are 2000 printed MASTA's.</strong> This should be enough to exchange for a sufficient amount of money to print the next edition in a smaller number and cover part costs for the meeting (travel and food). There you have it, the reason why we started asking money for our magazine.</p>
<p>That's not the only reason. We also think that if you enjoy something, in this case MASTA magazine,<strong> -wether you enjoy it because you find the articles interesting, or an action that you were involved in is mentioned, or you find it a nice platform to publish your material, or you like the layout, or you simply think it looks hip on your livingroom table-</strong> you can show your appreciation by making it able to keep going, by giving us some money. There is no need to put this in other words.</p>
<p><strong>What about '</strong><strong>the secret of how to get a copy of MASTA for free'?</strong></p>
<p>It is always nicer to <strong>get things you like for free!</strong> If you read the text you might have already figured it out: to pay for MASTA is not because some people get rich out of this project. Paying a for a copy is making it possible for MASTA to continue. So if you contribute to the MASTA-project in any way -writing an article, joining a crew, distribute (selling), organising a releaseparty or cooking at one of our meetings, I don't care- you can <strong>earn yourself a free copy of MASTA</strong>. It's as simple as that.</p>
<p>So, what do we get out of this? Well, it would be <strong>nice to have you in the projectnetwork</strong>.</p>
