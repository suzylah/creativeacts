Locking your kitchen-door behind you is like locking out the whole world. My kitchen is my fortress of forks, knives, plates, pots and healthy food; a hidden shelter where I can be forgotten; a magic place where I can feel like Odysseus in Aiaia, like Edgar Allan Poe in his Kingdom by the Sea, like Alice in her Wonderland; a safe, secret haven where I become whom I really am. </font></span></span></p>

Today, cooking for me is not just cooking, <span style="font-style: normal">as such</span>; rather, what you call cooking for me is my search for meaning, happiness and life's aims. It is my whole identity-pie carefully baked out of the most precious recipes from throughout my life. My dreams are here, at the bottom of these iron pots, waiting to boil up over the top and present some flavor to the world outside.</font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">When the sun starts rising, when it starts consuming the earth into its endless, bright stomach, I return home, head straight for the lingering piquant kitchen aromas via the esophagal corridor, ignoring the bland rooms on both sides. Apart from the savory, cozy kitchen, my house is tasteless: stark, bare and naked. I generally do not enjoy the presence of unnecessary dust collectors filling up the whole house. But when I took over my parents' home, I tried for a while to cope with the clutter, for weeks I removed, arranged and rearranged all the furniture, but no matter which way I designed it, it did not please my taste. Finally, I decided to release my inner emptiness from the secret room of my soul, its first step at the doormat of my home. The only room I all but left unchanged was my kitchen. </font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">Since you were probably wondering why I go home at the first rays of sunlight, I will share with you why my nights are your days and why during your days I don´t exist. As soon as I disappear behind my kitchen-door, I withdraw from life, as such. Before I disrobe my soul for your discerning eyes, dear Reader, I need you to promise not to judge me. I need you to understand me, be with me in my kitchen, look over my shoulder while I cook, and eat with me from my own plate. Always remember that, ultimately, empathy is the main ingredient of the dishes I will serve you in the next four courses of my menu. So please, Reader, be patient, try to imagine me most authentically, perceive me, otherwise, I probably won´t exist.</font></span></span></p>

I live on a a strict animal-products-diet. After having had my principal residence in my kitchen for several years already, I can tell you that healthy cooking has taken the place of sex in my life. In fact, I just had a giant mirror installed in the ceiling over my kitchen table. </font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">I strongly believe that eating animal products like meat, fish, natural animal fats, cheese, eggs etc. while restricting carbohydrates (mostly from vegetation) from one´s menu, does not only make a person healthier and live longer, but also prevents and cures major human diseases, starting from reducing cancer-tumors, to preventing heart attacks. The scientists now call these DOC's, (diseases of civilization).</font></span></span></p>

Talk to a mainstream doctor about a meat-and fat-diet instead of drugs to cure diabetes,</span></font><span lang="zxx"><font size="3"><span style="text-decoration: none"> and he will empty his whole garbage pail of thoughts right onto your head. Tell your caring mother or nurturing grandmother that you´d like to waive fruits and vegetables from your daily meals, and they will eat you alive. No failures in your academic life, no miserable jobs, not even a lousy choice of partner, nothing will shock them more than a sudden non-conventional change in your diet.</span></font></span></span></span></p>

In fact, by denying or not knowing that solid health depends on the quality of calories we ingest, and not their quantity,<font style="font-size: 13pt" size="3"> </font>the whole Western World is committing slow mass suicide. Whoever claims that it is not true, has not done his homework.</font></span></span></p>

Since our governments are not taking any responsibility to protect their subjects from the harmful shakes and sheiks of the food and pharmaceutical industries, another solution must be found; so, I have decided to rise up and struggle for human health by carrying the cross of their sins upon my compassionate shoulders. </font></span></span></p>

They will affect only a small number of select people. As a solution for the masses, my lonely fight has a clear expiration date. I will disappear like a little splash in a big puddle; but for the one, for the one person whose life I will make palatable, my small action will make the difference. And maybe, only maybe, my splash will not simply perish, but also wet some fortuitous observers and wake them from their nutritional slumber.</font></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">If you feel unable to change a problem, change your attitude towards it. I have chosen the only way I knew to cope with the problem of unhealthy diets: I started going to people´s houses and cooking for them. I don´t remember how exactly it all began...or maybe I just don´t want to tell you...but I always liked to watch others shop: Fat girls desperately hunting low-fat, sugary-yoghurts which promised them a rapid butt-reduction; diabetics proudly carrying home fructose-based diet chocolate (fructose is the worst type of sugar!), and vegetarians with meat-starved eyes jumping out like wild Tarzans from behind the shelves of vegetation packing dates and tropical fruits in their veiny hands. </font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">Yet, a few years and several supermarkets later, I happened to feel nostalgic about these people´s lost future, and though compassion soaked itself through every single one of my fibers, I was too shy to argue with these naïve victims of errant health enlightenment, even to call their attention to the ingredients listed on the packages of their future meals. </font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">The more I pitied these victims of the system, the more I realized that pity is a sign of being human, but a bad habit to have. It teaches us to be passive to other people´s misery. By ignoring their grievances, we actually deny their existence. I did not want to choke on my own compassion towards these fellow humans, so I decided to go through the whole ordeal and chop through and sift out the obstacles. </font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">And here´s how I do it: I break into people´s houses to cook for them, throw out their junk food and rearrange their lives and the lives inside their refrigerators. I´m not a simple burglar, though if I find money or articles of value, I do take them with me of course as a kind of allowance and also in order to cover my shopping expenses (Sorry to disappoint you this time but nowadays only birds volunteer to sing for free). </font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">Usually it takes me a long time until I am satisfied with the results of my projects. Normally, I choose the worst shopper in the supermarket and accompany him or her for several weeks on disastrous shopping-tours. I carefully keep a diary about the food my godchild buys, study his/her taste, and take notes on the amount of carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fats in every purchase. I always feel with every new person as if I´m starting anew. Each one of them becomes a unique fragment of my private life.</font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">After knowing all their eating habits and designing a menu for the one I´ve chosen, I start waiting... I wait for the risky and exciting part to begin, when he or she leaves the house for a night or for the whole weekend to come back and discover that someone has been taking care of his/her kitchen. </font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">I love my job, and I strongly believe that we should be doing what we love, otherwise, if you have never done what you love, what have you done then? Good food adds such a pleasant taste to the world that you stop caring whether what you do is “right” or “wrong”, as long as it is a part of its preparation process.</font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">I often go back weeks after accomplishing my mission to make sure that the hosts have adopted my concept. In case they went back to their suicidal lifestyle, I am forced to break into their kitchen anew, eliminate the poisons and replace them again with healthy, life-extending meats. It is my major goal to achieve long-term changes in people´s eating behavior. Yet, of course, even I have my limitations: Saving their lives is not worth losing mine. I cannot afford dying for a goal...but I can afford to live for one. I learned it from my friend Dostoyevsky who said: “<span style="text-decoration: none">The secret of man's being is not only to live but to have something to live for.”</span></font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">I remember this huge house I had to break into twelve times. The owner was a British diabetic with a 2x2m refrigerator overfilled with fruit juices, diet-chocolate (with 72g carbs per 100g!), and all sorts of pastries. He obviously didn´t appreciate my cooking and always left my dishes untouched, thus making me feel humiliated and angry. On night twelve he happened to be prepared for my usual so-well-organized visits. No, he hadn´t called the police, he was welcoming me with a flashlight in the lingering darkness of his living room. </font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">“Don´t move! Who are you and what do you want here?!” he yelled at me. And I was thinking “No wonder the British have always been known for their sense of hospitality,” while viewing his elephantine mass removing some of the air from the room, shifting its enormous weight from one leg to another, as if neither of them would volunteer to take responsibility for its burden.</font></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">I was amused by the fact that it took him twelve weeks to discover my regular appearances. Well, constantly keeping in mind on my ephemeral sojourns that I am only a guest chef, I never leave any signs of intrusion. As Adorno said “The highest form of morality is not to feel at home in other people´s houses.” The only indicators of an external break-in are the cooked meals and the obligatory <span style="background: transparent">removal </span>of <span style="background: transparent">unhealthy junk.</span> </font></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 200%" align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="3">Whenever I doubt or hesitate implementing the disposal-strategy, I hear Dostoyevsky whispering softly into my ear: “<span style="text-decoration: none">A just cause is not ruined by a few mistakes.” No dilemma there! I</span> do not consider myself a murderer, perhaps a mild killer, but definitely not a piquant, low-class murderer, since I don't intend or enjoy killing people, heavens no! It´s simply a necessary measure in ominous situations. This is self-defense, after all! I´m a fighting soldier with a cause! I have the aim to defend, not to kill. So far my mission required only five lives, that's not bad, I dare say, considering all the risks I take with multiple intrusions to each slovenly kitchen! And even with such moral justification, I still remember and venerate all of them: The ballerina-lady who gracefully set her dog against me (how dare she after all I'd done for her asthmatic condition); the chubby surgeon (who had probably more people on his conscience than I do); the married couple who suddenly returned home early when I expected them to be on vacation, and the guy who almost got away safely...</font></span></span></p>

I was surprised by the <span style="background: transparent">pleasant aroma</span> that filled the room into which I´d climbed. As I turned on the light to estimate the arrangement, I got surprised again finding immaculate tidiness and all the furniture arranged with subtle taste. After having spent a few minutes absorbing the presentation of perfect indoor harmony, I <span style="background: transparent">followed the spoor </span>of the magnetic smell. I opened the door that was separating me from what turned out to be the kitchen. A young man was sitting at the round table which had a mirror of the same size and shape hanging over it, and was writing something into a pocketbook.

I feel sorry for you though…and for the book I won`t be able to complete any more. There are only three more chapters left. I would have been so happy to have written it to the end.”</font></span></span></p>

His face expression looked much softer than that of my earlier victims. I kept staying beside his resting body for a long time. I was feeling nauseous. When I broke his skull, another dull crack echoed from somewhere in the depth of myself. I sensed the loss of something very significant without knowing exactly what it was. I felt as lonely in my life as he was in his death. There were tears in my heart before they became visible in my eyes. I could have cried the Mississippi River...cried over this strange man, cried over his unfinished novel, cried over the still existing endlessness of people with bad eating habits... .</font></span></span></p>

That night was the first night in years I had spent strolling thoughtfully through the lifeless rooms of my house. The reality has acquired the quality of a dream. I had left him in his apartment, but he hasn´t left me. <span style="background: transparent">His words remained in my head when I was preparing my breakfast...and lunch...and dinner...and breakfast... . </span>He felt sorry for me he had said.

Their passed lives gain more mystery and complexity in retrospective. A human life consists of an indefinite number of opportunities. A lost opportunity can, if you´re lucky, sometimes be taken back, but dying means losing all your opportunities at once and never getting them back. </font></span></span></p>

An irreplaceable chapter of another person`s life? Saying yes entails that someone else could have started this chapter before you; that it is interspersed with foreign styles, languages, and concepts. How do you finish the book having only that little empty space left for yourself? How do you fit in without having to pull out some of your own pages, or destroying the entire story? </font></span></span></p>

I began to search for some sort of meaning in somebody else´s long lost life. Ever since I have adopted this task, I have ceased cooking for other people, I have even stopped cooking for myself. I was all consumed by the fixed idea of filling my own senselessness with his dream. <span style="background: transparent">I became an inarticulate writer of another author´s book.</span></font></span></span></p>

It is the only way I know to give some fresh breath and rhythm to my lame inspiration. </font></span></span></p>

As I passed through my kitchen to scan quickly the nowadays so empty stomach of my refrigerator, I discovered a big salad bowl coquettishly glancing at me from the set kitchen table. It was beautiful: A gorgeous masterpiece bouquet of leaves and vegetables was flourishing in the desert of my kitchen.</font></span></span></p>
