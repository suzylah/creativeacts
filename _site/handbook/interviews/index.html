<p>Singing Skopjans (Распеани скопјани) is an activist choir based in Skopje, Macedonia. Their actions in the public space represent “an attempt to intervene in the violent polarized discourse in which the voices of the different are not heard, but the voices of the more powerful are”. They describe themselves as a thought articulated in music and performance that tackles the current social and political issues in the city and the world in which they live in. As they say for themselves:</p>

<p>Ruuta and Kaj, from Mašta crew, had already met up with the activist group Fuck For Forest a couple of years ago and put out an introductory article that was published in  issue #7 of Masta Magazine. This time, Tau and Kaj went over to their headquarters in Friedrichshain, Berlin to see how things are developing for them and to go deeper into their philosophy and the way they run their almost 10 year old Ecoporn Non Profit Organisation.</p>

We started to think about what kind of activities such a collective would carry out. To answer this question we started to experiment with this concept and registered the domain molestar.org and then came the first actions.</p>

<p>Along with many other EU Southern and Easter European countries, Hungary was forced to seek help from the International Monetary Fund for its debt woes. But there weren’t only the financial issues starting to worry Hungarian society. The conservative government took a pretty controversial path that triggered the protests of thousands of citizens that flooded the streets. On that occasion, the demonstration’s call taking place in the fall of 2011 in Budapest – coinciding with the 55th anniversary of the 1956 Revolution— included a soundtrack that quickly became a massive hit on Youtube. “I don’t like, I don’t like, I don’t like the system”.</p>
