    <p>Here you find a collection of action reports. You can find reports written by the collectives themselves or summarised by the editors of Masta collective. Here you find first hand narrations about how an idea for an action was born and put in practice, and what kind of effects it did have.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This chapter will never be closed. We started it with a selection of actions and you are invited to join us expanding it by submitting actions. Rather than collecting an encyclopedic amount of data about creative acts around the globe, we wish to find a representative selection, inlcuding examples of creative activism from every corner of this lovely planet - from small rural villages to metropolises, from people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>

        <p class="card-text"><p>Between the compact mass of protesters, a minor disturbance starts; a small group of people moving in the crowd until they form a circle. Slowly, as soldiers thoroughly prepare their weapons, violins, flutes and other instruments appear from their bags and they start doing musical chores. The crowd falls silent and listen. Touched. Solfónica is playing. If you’ve been lucky enough to witness this scene it is not necessary to explain who they are. Solfónica will probably be there at a moment in your life that you’ll never forget.</p>

Its intention is to consider the relationship between man and nature and to decentralize the culture of cities and redirect it to the rural world. Our interests are focused on the research of the ecology, design, contemporary art and agriculture.</p>

It forms a counterpart to the glorification of consumption, elitist design, body cult and unsustainable conditions of production evident in fashion culture.</p>

<p>The critique of Butt x Better, however, is expressed in diverse, undogmatic and humoristic ways. Its main elements include upcycling workshops, music shows, exhibitions of room and light installations as well as a colourful demonstration and rave through the city center.</p>

<p>Ciclocolor, by Bici-brochas<br /><br /> Having a bike as vehicle and paint as a tool, "Bici-Brochas" brings new colourful lines to the asphalt and, according to the chosen route, leaves a hint of colour that breaks up with the sobriety of the metropolis and the smoke coming from cars.<br /> The “cacharro” consists of an inverted bottle as a tank and a tap, which allows the flow of paint to the pavement through a broom turned paintbrush, illustrating the route created by the cyclist.<br /> The action aims to draw attention to bicycles as a sustainable, human-powered, healthy and economical means of transport, as opposing to motor vehicles, which literally invade in grey our cities and our little thongs.</p>

        <p class="card-text"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10 Tactics – for turning information into action is a toolkit for info-activism; it includes a documentary film, presenting the tactics and material for learning more. The film shows rights advocates from different countries working on grass root level with human rights issues. The film was shot in 2009, and it sheds light on many of the issues that reached mainstream media with the wave of protests in 2011.</p>
<p>The film is a good discussion opener in groups that work with human rights and new media. It gives ideas about actions that can be done, but warns also about taking care about the people that participate. The film and educational material about the 10 Tactics are creative commons licensed, so anyone can set up a film screening. The film can be downloaded from:&nbsp;<a avglsprocessed="1" href="http://www.informationactivism.org/" target="_blank">http://www.<wbr />informationactivism.org</a></p>

        <p class="card-text"><p>There is nothing more political than food you eat, clothes you wear ... and Your body hair? If we assume that political is equal to socially active, recently we came across another example of politicised bodyhair - MOVEMBER movement."Face grown &amp; hand brushed" -&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/files/u5/banner_blank.jpg" style="width: 317px; height: 56px; float: right; " /></p>
<p>some guys from Australia has started a world wide movement to raise awareness and also cash. "Never dreaming that facial hair would ultimately lead to a global movement that would get men talking about a taboo subject – their health ..."</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>However, growing moustache seems to be an effective way to get people talking about problems, what seems to be uncomfortable to talk about. However, the choice to grow or cut hair seems to be an issue since ages - certain haircut as sign for tribal recognition, religios terms (like muslim woman coverin their hair, or ). As well, it can serve as sign of rebellion, if one let her strand of hair to slip out from the headscarf, or shave some parts of head. Of course, talking about body hair, its impossible to skip the idea about liberating the people from imposed beauty standarts what tells, when, where and how the hair should grow. As a friend once answered to a question, if hair on her legs is feministic hair - "no, its just my body hair".</p>
<p>However, sticking back to men's health and Movember, Maštazine invites You to contribute with a storry on moustache (or any other) &nbsp;body hair action until 1st of December to editor@mastazine.net, pictures are welcome as well! The nicest storry will be published in this blog and You will get Mašta magazine in Your postbox!</p>

<p>“Something big is happening in the plazas and streets of the United States. Emerging from the Occupy Wall Street encampment in New York, a new movement has taken shape that seems to transcend what many organizers have classically envisioned a mass social movement against the economic system looking like… but it’s shaping up to be one!</p>

<p>The idea is to leave around notes, images, boxes and whatever one can come up with.<br />Purpose? Set people's thoughts and smiles on fire!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin by finding quotes and questions that you find smile and thought provoking. What message do you want to spread? Depending on season, place and yourself you might want to spread different messages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write the quotes and questions down, by hand or machine. Then photocopy!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make some boxes! With simple origami you make boxes to put your messages in. And then writing things such as ”pick me up” or ”for you” on the lid. You can also decide to put objects such as paper hearts or candies inside, with your imagination telling you what.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put it all together. Either keep the messages for books and food packages or put them in then boxes together with some objects. Done!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are now fully prepared! Go out onto the streets, find passing peoples bags, bicycle baskets and mail boxes. Any place where you find it needed. Also go to the bookshops, libraries and supermarket and plant some seed thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope this idea will go far beyond notes&amp;boxes, use your imagination<br /><br />Will you help us? <a href="http://www.get-growing.blogspot.com/">http://www.get-growing.blogspot.com/</a>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project made by action group during training "Stream it!
