We are an international collective of journalists, writers, artists, researchers, makers, third party fists and we multiply and report on creative acts that do reflect the world we actually live in. We realize the Ma≈°ta magazine to report on innovative ways to address social-political problems and to inspire old and mobilize new forces for social change.
