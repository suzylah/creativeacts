Each of the participants gets stickers or markers in three different colors. They have 6 votes in total, 2 in each category - in the first round 2 colors will be used for the following categories _–most innovative idea, the best idea–_ (each facilitator can choose the categories that suit the group).

The participants can give their votes to the ideas anonymously, one by one, or all together - depending from the size of the group. The facilitators summarizes the results of the voting and invites group to reflect on the result (depending from the size of the group - all together, or in smaller groups).

*Analyzing the ideas*
First analyze the ideas that did not get any votes
Instead of asking _"Why is this a bad idea?"_ ask _"How can we make this idea interesting?"_
The facilitator takes care that during the critical selection the positive side of the arguments are always seen. For example, a participant says _"We will never get local people to participate in this action"_ - facilitator can ask _"Ok, so how can we make this idea more interesting to the local audience?"_ or another example - a participant says _"this will only attract men"_ - a facilitator can ask _"how can we encourage gender balance in the activities?"_
After summarizing the ideas after the critical selection, the facilitator invites people to use their last 2 dots and vote on the ideas again.

*Group reflection round*
The facilitator asks the group to reflect on surprise moments during the exercise as well as what things did not changed the perspective of the participants.
