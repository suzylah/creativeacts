<div>If you empty your brain - there will be more space for new ideas. So lets get everything out of your head onto paper and organize it better!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This method is helpful when you need to start up an idea session, giving your brain a fresh new sheet to start from. It can also be used as a way &nbsp;to structure your thoughts and the tasks gathered in your mind, &nbsp;where &nbsp;the output can be a to-do list or a time-line with tasks mapped to it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Empty Brain method is about getting everything out of your head and down on paper so that you can stop thinking about it. It can be done in a group as well as individually. If driven by a facilitator, the role is to be responsible for setting up the method for &nbsp;how to empty the brain. E.g. choose between mind mapping/time-lining/others.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Simply write down everything you have on your mind on paper, do not discriminate between important and less important while writing, you can do that later if you really want to. Let everything from <em>"remember to buy bread" </em>to "<em>contact the band playing tomorrow at the event i am organizing" </em>be part. After you have emptied your brain, let the notes rest, while you carry on with getting ideas with a fresh mind. If you want, you can always get back to the notes after you have your new ideas in place, and structure it to a task list, but that is more like a side effect of the exercise.</div>
