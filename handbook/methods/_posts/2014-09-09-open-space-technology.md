We have adapted Open space technology for structuring ideas for actions and planning when to realize them.

First, ask participants to write down their action ideas and their name on papers. The person who write the action idea is going to be the responsible for it. Participants can write as many ideas as they want and, as well, not write any. After everyone finishes, the group start an explanation round where each of participants explain about their idea or ideas. Other participant can ask questions to get more info about them. After the explanation round, people stick their papers on one wall. Now participants read the actions ideas and write down their name in the ones they would like to be involved in, taking into account that they can not be in all of them. When people finish to choose, facilitator presents a timetable with different time slots. The time slots could be from 2 hours. Now is time for each responsible to place their paper with their action idea in one or more time slots, depending how much time they will need to organize and make the concrete action. When the papers are placed, the group together check the timetable and see if everybody agrees on it. If there are disagreements, participants and facilitator try to find a solution together changing things in the timetable.
