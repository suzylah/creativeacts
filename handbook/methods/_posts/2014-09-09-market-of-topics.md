Collect their thoughts on post-it notes and hang them visible on a wall. Divide into sub-groups. In order to do this, set up the room with three type of tools for creative activism and ask the participants to choose the one they felt most connected to. They then divide into three subgroups accordingly. Of course, you can use any means to split the group. Each group will be asked to pick a topic from the „Market of topics“ and plan an action taking into account the context and somehow incorporating the tool which they felt affiliated with.</span></p>
