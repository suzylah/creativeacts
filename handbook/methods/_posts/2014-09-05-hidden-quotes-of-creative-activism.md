Before the group arrives, hide the quotes in different places of the room. When they come are in the room ask them to look for the quotes. Ask them to keep in mind, that some of the quotes are related with creative activism and some of them are not. Tell them that there is only three quotes related with creative activism, and ask them to select which ones. Give the group some time and space to discuss if the quotes they find are related or not, and when they agree that they have three notes, ask them to share which quotes they selected.
 
Analyze the three quotes with the group and create a common definition of creative activism.  For example, if you have "Be the change you wish to see in the world" by Gandhi ask "What does it means to BE the change?" "How can you be the change and encourage others to be this change?" "What kind of changes do we need in ourselves and in the society?"

Some quotes will more likely be in the selection than others, not only because of their content, but also because of their author. Probably the group will agree that there are more than three quotes related to creative activism, but some are more related than others, and some have not relation at all.

For example, they might agree that "You teach a child to read, and he or she will be able to pass a literacy test" by George W. Bush is not related at all, and that who wrote it has a big impact on this decision. In this moment you can facilitate the discussion, explaining that the quote, which all of them agree as non related, actually could be related. In the example, Bush, is speaking about critical thinking and the educational system. This could be an example to explain, how we need to teach children not only to read, but also to understand what they are reading.  If this way of interpreting the quote would be correct, the quite will be related. Discussing how you could relate everything with creative activism will break the thinking patterns around the topic. 

From this point you can explore the ideas they had before about creative activism with questions like: "Did your understanding about creative activism change? How?"  "Which one of the quotes reflects creative activism best?"
