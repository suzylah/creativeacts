What do you think they know allready? Estimating the knowledge of your group, can be very difficult, especially if you work with mixed groups or in an open setting like for example a festival. If &nbsp;you notice the group seem to need more basic knowledge, or more high level content while you present, it can be good to have thought about how you can tweak your presentation so that it becomes more understandable, or include more of the experiences of the group.</p>

If your audience has brought examples, you can sort them in this structure on a wall, or ask them to what kind of catagory their example would belong. Be prepared to add new catagories.&nbsp;</p>
