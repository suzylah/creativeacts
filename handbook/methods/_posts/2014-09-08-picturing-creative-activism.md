Ask them, how they will classify the other pictures and try to initiate a deeper discussion by asking questions like "How does one choose what type of action they make?" "Which one do you think is more effective?" "In which picture are you most likely to be involved?" "Have you been involved in any of this situations?" It is really interesting to provide some time for the participants to share their experiences and discuss how they felt and why they decided to take action or be passive, and how.</span></p>
