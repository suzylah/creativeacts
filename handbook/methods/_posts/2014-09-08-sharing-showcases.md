The type of actions and videos you choose will depend on the type of group you are working with. Show the group different videos and during the process ask them questions. You can use each video to present a type of creative actions or to show a concrete collective that works in your local area. Some examples of questions could be: What type of creative action is it? Did you know about this collective? What would you think about this action if you would have seen it in real life? Do you think this type of action is suitable for your local area? What is the topic behind this action? and so on.</span></p>
