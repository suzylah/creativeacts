Before the exercise prepare six signs: Why, What, Who, Where, When and How.

<!--more-->

Divide into 6 groups. Give each person a paper with Why, What, Who, Where, When and How. Ask them to move around and organize themselves in a way so that they show the order of importance or the chronological order you need to answer to each question when you are organizing an action. This will create a discussion: "What comes first, because you need to know what you want to do?", "Why comes first, because you need a reason to do what you do?". Leave some time to discuss and reach an agreement. When they agree, try to challenge their decision with questions that make them reflect about their preconceptions like: "If your action is about changing a neighborhood, then the first one will be "Where", right?" "Do you always have a reason before you start to do something and does your reason&nbsp; change while doing it?"
