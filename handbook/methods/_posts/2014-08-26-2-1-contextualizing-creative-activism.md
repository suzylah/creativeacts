<p>Creative activism as such need a social context to make sense, without connections with the society it will appear empty. An action taken out of its context, placed in a different society, will not necessarily have the same effect or even serve a similar purpose as the original. Though there are shareable tactics and tools which are vividly used and applied in many communities around the globe, it is a consideration to develop an understanding of the context in which you operate. By reflecting over the context and plan actions using an bottom-up process, you can avoid making actions that seem out of place, become misunderstood, or considered to be pointless.</p>
