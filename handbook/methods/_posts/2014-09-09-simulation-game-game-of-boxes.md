Firstly participants individually reflect about three concrete issues that concern or affect them. After 10 min individuals gather in small groups of four or five people. If the group is small, it could be as well in groups of three. The groups share the topics and choose one for the group.

After that we present 3 boxes: in one of them there are folded papers with names of places, for example, university, shopping centre, school, village, etc...; in another one there are folded papers with different target groups: women, kids, consumers, etc....; in the other one there are folded papers with creative activism techniques with an explanation: craftivism, performance, light graffiti, theatre, etc... Each group can choose one paper from each box so they have a topic + a place + a target group and technique to design an action together.

When the groups are ready with their actions you can either provide time for them to go “ hands on “ and try out the action or directly analyze them in plenary without trying them. In both cases, keep time for groups to present and analyze their action taking in account the different factors (topic, place, target group and technique) and their relations.
