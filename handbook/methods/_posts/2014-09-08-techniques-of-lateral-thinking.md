Associate the object or the noun with the area you are thinking about. For example<em>, you are thinking about how to improve a website. An object chosen at&nbsp; random from the surrounding environment might be a fax machine.&nbsp;</em>

Fax machines are becoming rare. People send faxes directly to phone numbers.

<strong>Tips:&nbsp;</strong>

While brainstorming on different nouns, try not to switch immediately to choosing best ideas. When you feel happy/tired enough with rushing over with your bright ideas - find some minutes to run through your creations one by one together to check which of them are liked the best and can be applied

<strong>Provocation</strong>
Fit yourselves in small groups and choose one of the Provocation Technics for you to start on: wishful thinking, exaggeration, reversal, escape or distortion. For example, if you aim to engage more people for your student group, - reversal of reasons - why people would not join, can actually help to come up with points you would forget to think about before coming up with decision. Challenging the assumption that people should join at all - escaping it - can help to reveal new possibilities to do your things.
	
After a group of thinkers created a list of all these crazy provocation, most outlandish ones can be chosen to move forward to new ideas.
	
<strong>Challenge</strong>

Asking “Why?” in a non-threatening way is the main idea of this method.

This approach is about finding out why something exists, why it is done the way it is. The result is a very clear understanding of “Why?” which naturally leads to fresh new&nbsp; ideas. The goal is to be able to challenge anything at all, not just&nbsp; items which are problems. For example,<em> one could challenge the handles on coffee cups. The reason for the handle seems to be that the cup is often too hot to hold directly. Perhaps coffee cups could be made with insulated finger grips, or there could be separate coffee cup&nbsp; holders similar to beer holders.</em>

<strong>Disproving</strong>


Place yourselves in smaller groups (3-5 people) and your minds in state of thinking that the majority is always wrong. Your task is to take anything that is obvious, generally accepted as "goes without saying" and question it. Take an opposite view, and try to convincingly disprove it. When the group feels finished with the exercise make a round to sum up conclusions.
