Ask the participants to write ideas associated to this topic, creating different branches coming from it. When you have several ideas you can start to make connections between your branches or</span><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size: 13.63636302947998px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size: 13.63636302947998px; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;create new branches within the ones created.</span>&nbsp;After some time, when your map have had time to grow, select some of the connections and start a discussion about them. The mind map can be a tool that you can have present during all your sessions/training and you can come back to at any point to refresh your thoughts about the topic. Such a flip chart paper can help you to build understanding among each other and during a discussion or heavy argument can be an efficient tool for better communication.</span></p>

We can call this an idea-tree. If you don't have one specific idea in mind but you are thinking about the relation between more ideas, or just want to chart out lots of ideas, we recommend you to draw idea-graphs instead of using mind maps.</p>
