Living in the "information overload age" has challenged the classical civic engagement, in the process of reaching and engaging members. We are receiving millions of visual, audio and kinesthetic signals every day are quite likely to loose focus, or feel overwhelmed. <!--more-->We find that using proper tools to analyze the context of the society and ones place is a great help to the messenger to deliver his or her story.


<blockquote>
The function of creative activism is to facilitate change in an unexpected way
</blockquote>

Already in 1940Â´s the first ideas about upcoming problematic to systemize and process the information in human time and with human brain appeared; but now its our daily struggle - either its getting through the email, following up all the social contacts on- and off-line or training the media literacy skills. The human brain has extensive opportunities to perceive information, especially visual impulses but its the mind that buffers the processing of all the input.

The overload of information guides and builds our way of life (protocols, social norms, roles, power relations, mass control strategies, emotional manipulation, consumerist behavior etc...). We are constantly transmitting information via the way we walk and speak, with our bodily expressions or in our social and habitual behavior. In summary, we are micro-political entities in our daily actions.

Despite on that overload, there is always a piece of reality that gets through and manages to reach us and somehow affect us. The information stays with us. This is the moment when something starts to grow inside us, is the necessity to interact and react, the creative activism cell is activated and growing inside us.

We claim the responsible facilitation of change in an unexpected way being the core function of the creative activism. Therefore orientating well in the context, knowing your place in it and reaching the right ears and eyes is directly affected by the classical problematic of the information overload. To activate the cells in society, we see it essential to make information processing tools and methods open and accessible for the people.

As social beings we have the power to modify and improve our environment: the personal context, life story and personal history makes up the basis of the field in which we operate. Analyzing the kind of world that surrounds one is the first step in opening ones mind to new processes of understanding of the environment. The second step is to research the target group, knowing exactly whom we are sending the message - not only people who might be interested but mainly the ones that must know that. The ones who will keep our message, process and react on it.

There are plenty of theories researching on what activates the cells in society, our approach is to observe, learn the context and get to know the people involved to deliver the message of activism in the right hands and right moment.
