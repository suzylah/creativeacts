There are a thousand ways to explain and transmit how creative activism operates, lives and breathes. In this book, we have chosen the metaphor of the "cell" to explore and approach the creative activism ecosystem.

<blockquote>
“To dismantle and reinvent institutions or systems we have to start at the roots, with the culture that supports them. Culture is the material substratum of politics, the muddy foundations upon which they are built, but these foundations can’t be changed in the same way that you can undo a law - they are transformed by infiltrating them at the molecular level, through the fault lines, pores and gaps, burrowing away like an old mole opening up millions of potential north- west passages” 
Gavin Grindon &amp; John Jordan, _"A users guide to demand the imposible"_

The cell is the smallest unit of life. It has a dynamic structure and a membership base. The cell basically builds us as we are. Furthermore it is the main element in the processes of growth and transformation. The main function of the cell is the metabolism. Metabolism comes from a Greek word which means change. This is also the main function of Creative Activism: change.




Our body is composed by million of cells that support a variety of life processes: neurons, adipocytes, ephitelial cells, spermatozoons and egg cells and many more...

Also inside us there are small cells that run through our body, waiting to be activated. These cells are responsible to make us aware, and make us act. They provoke in us the necessity of finding an answer to what surrounds us. They encourage us to combine our ideas with others. These are creative activism cells

Each component of this concrete type of cell reflects upon a part of the creative activism process. Let us take a look at the structure.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 13.63636302947998px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(59, 59, 59);">Despite the many differences in appearance and function, all cells are wrapped in a membrane, semipermeable or selective. The membrane regulates the passage of substances into the cell and vice versa. In the case of the creative activism cell, this part is the critical consciousness, that helps us to analyze our reality. The critical thinking also select and filter the information that reaches us, letting through what we consider important and to affect us.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 13.63636302947998px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(59, 59, 59);">Within the cell there are different components that react and become active as soon as the information is passed into the cell. What is the function of these components? To analyze information and reduce it into smaller parts in order to understand it better. Something similar occurs during the creative process of creating an action, where each person becomes an element which analyzes reality differently.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 13.63636302947998px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(59, 59, 59);">The nucleus is the most important part of the cell. It controls and synthesizes the information. It organizes everything and then sends the "molecular message". This "molecular message" is composed of the information we want to convey and the way in which we will pass it on.</p>
