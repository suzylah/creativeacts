## How to print the book
1. To print the book, download the [PDF file](https://www.mastazine.net/handbook/download) either of the whole book, or the chapter you want to print.
2. If you use Adobe Acrobate, you will find the same options when printing as show in the pictures below.
First select print as "booklet".

Choose "properties" and choose double sided print<
To bind the book, it is good to make sections, so called signatures. Therefore print pages in sections, first page 1-32, then 33 - 64 etc.
Fold the sections, and you are ready to bind the books!
