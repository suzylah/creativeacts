Mašta is an open platform for creativity, freedom and action. The word Mašta means imagination. It also means whatever.&nbsp;Mašta&nbsp;is&nbsp;an international collective of journalists, artists, researchers, makers and other creative souls. We are here to explore, provoke, inspire and to look at the way of change. We receive reports form individuals and groups who do creative actions in public space and&nbsp;report on innovative ways to address social-political problems and to inspire old and mobilize new forces for social change.&nbsp;Images, articles, artwork and ideas are shared, and people like you make Mašta possible.&nbsp;Spread the word and don't hesitate to contact us!
