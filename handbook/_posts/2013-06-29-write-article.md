<p>Below are some guidelines about what could be included in the text, which can help you make an interesting article.</p>
<h2>INTERVIEWS</h2>
<h3>TECHNICAL GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>Length: 2-3 book pages = 700/1000 words<br>
	Document format: .txt, .doc, .odt, .html<br>
	Formatting: Serif or Sans-Serif Font, 10-11 pt</p>
<p>Short intro: provide the most relevant background info.<br>
	Interview: Q&amp;A trying to follow a reasonable content thread</p>
<p>Include in the document you send: your name and contact details (email) as well as the name of the collective and contact person and email.</p>
<h3>What to ask?</h3>
<p>How to find the way to creative activism? What is the motivation for such acts? How does it feel like to be involved in creative activism? What are the challenges? Why? What have you learned in the process? These are just some questions we try to answer in the Handbook. Basically, any questions that you think of–as an interviewer for this project, and therefore interested/involved in creative activism—that are relevant for this research and could help reveal the full nature of creative activism would be suitable!</p>
<h3>How to ask?</h3>
<p>Background Info: Make sure you know as much as possible about the person you are interviewing to get the relevant information. As in every general interview, there is some basic information you need to gather as a background, so you can place your interview in context. Sometimes you find a lot as part of your research process and the interview is just about confirming data, though sometimes you have to ask directly the most simple details such as: The history of the collective (where, when, why and by who was funded), how many members they are, in which concrete context (socio-political) they work …</p>
<h3>Getting into the field</h3>
<p>If you/we chose a certain collective for the interviews part, it is because it has something that we think is relevant enough to be shared with the rest of the world through our handbook. So, try to focus your questions on their personal experience, opinion and testimony. Get to the point: What is creative activism for you? / What and who is behind your actions or projects? / Is the action the goal itself? / What moves a collective to become involved in this kind of activism? / What methods or techniques do you use more or even would define your collective? / Why creative activism and not art or employ traditional metods of activism? / Is it for you a job, a source of entertainment, a way of life? / … Questions about expectations-motivations-maybe disappointments and obstacles? Come to an interesting conclusion because a bit of reflection is always needed.</p>
<p>In case you have further doubts on what exactly to look for in your interviews we have a list that is not mandatory but can provide additional orientation:</p>
<h3>Interview checklist:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Is it easy to understand?</li>
	<li>Is there a clear description of character/collective?</li>
	<li>Is there an reasoned choice of interviewee?</li>
	<li>Does the interview contian more information than you can find on Google?</li>
	<li>Are the goals of the activity apparent?</li>
	<li>Does the interview explain what made the person into an activist?</li>
	<li>Is there reasoning described step by step?</li>
	<li>Is the interview personal?</li>
	<li>Is the context described?</li>

</ul>
