Nobody knows who they are, where they come from and how many people actually stand behind the signature humoenlaciudad (in English smoke in the city). Humoenlaciudad is simply a sign - a sign that something is happening in the public space - but, what matters more, is what happens after the sign has been made. <!--more-->

<p>The goal of this collective is to practice new ways of opening and reclaim public spaces. Their tactic is to liberate spaces by making it more accessible for the community. "Imagine a spontaneous accumulation of disobedient, independent and anonymous elements which creates a new perception of public space."</p>
<p>As humoenlaciudad breaks with established rules and expectations, instead of doing an interview, they preferred to give an overview, with the aim of turning the process into something more organic, interactive and rhizomatic. humoenlaciudad answer one question, which is subsequently followed by another question from them to you. The structure of the overview is circular; it begins and ends with the same question.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Mašta: When you say “free” does it means the same as "belongs to everybody"?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Humoenlaciudad: </strong>Free does not mean belongs to everybody, but it is accessible for everyone. "Free" is not a inherent condition related to something: It is a way of acting. It is not really important that something has an “owner”. We do not need to be owners of a street, a house or an hospital. The important thing is to create the appropriate conditions, so that they can be used for free.<strong> </strong><strong>Does everybody want the responsibility of living free?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Mašta:</strong><strong> Where does humoenlaciudad's public space begin?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Humoenlaciudad: </strong>The notion of public space is in the inframinimum. Where your skin ends, the public space begins, your freedom and everyone elses. The vital space that is around us is an appropriation. We move in the common space; the uncertainty area. <strong>Are we ready to face this?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Mašta: </strong><strong>Which implications are there when the practitioners of this space act instead of look?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Humoenlaciudad: </strong>Magic happens as the generic city ends. It is basic to break the rules: to stop the habitual flow, to interact with other users, to position yourself into the city design in which we are forced to live, to live in the common spaces in a free and open way. <strong>Does the user's apathy make a city or the does the city make the user passive? </strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Mašta:</strong><strong> Terrorist rituals?</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>Humoenlaciudad: </strong>The cities have became a schizoid environment. We have lost control without being aware. We require the need to recover our boundaries with the city; creating direct action rites: Anti alienating activities, generating uniqueness. Each member is self-coordinating and self-managing their own projects. Individually or jointly originate all types of proposals for the open exploration of public space, could be painting, sculpture, performance, etc... The way does not matter. We believe in the process, the links that are created in each action, development and collective intelligence. It is not about terror; it is about activities against the structural terrorism and violence that the sovereign states have on the citizens through city planning, advertising and common welfare laws...<br>
	<br>
	We don't need rules, we need freedom to elaborate our plans and apply our ways of action. ... We live inside of an internal and universal representation field which changes our beliefs into a real act of violence.&nbsp; If public space begins where our skin ends, then fear and violence begin before. This means the internal is conditional on the external circumstances. We don't believe in anything, we try everything to achieve a permanent analytical state. <strong>What does this overview gives to you?</strong></p>
