We tackle the obstacles built from fear of the unexpected  built not only by the same old evil corporations and conservative governments, but also by consumers and community members themselves.

We knock on the gates of the unexpected by visiting Spanish squares where people cry out for a united voice of society. We enter the struggle to reclaim public space in Kurdistan and basic human rights in The Fortress Europe. And when knocking on the gates is not enough we knock down the walls of expectations, following on the tracks of creative activism.
