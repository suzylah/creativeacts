title: We play in public space
---

With nine people and a van we drove to a town called Kielce. We wanted to play in public space. We wanted to change the images in the street. Call it a street action. When we arrived we split up in two groups to go and buy whatever we thought we would need. So after some serious shopping we ended up with:

- Two rolls of toilet
paper
- Two rolls of thin
white painters tape
- One roll of big white
painters tape
- A knife
- Some black and red
markers

And this is what we
did with it
