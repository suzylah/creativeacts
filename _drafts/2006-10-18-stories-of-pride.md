Hard times for the pride festivals
in eastern Europe

This summer the pride festivals in Poland, Latvia
and Estonia have had resistance from aggressive
anti-demonstrators. Also in other countries pride
parades had to cope with anti-demonstrators.
However this happened more peacefully.
In Warsaw –where the march was celebrated in
spite of some political oppression against it- the
police had to protect the parade from people
throwing eggs and insults on them. In Riga even
excrements were thrown. Here the police have
been criticized for being passive in protecting the

festival. That happens more often. In Tallinn there
were both police and private security guards on
site, but they were too few to prevent attacks from
happening. 30 young skinheads injured 12 people
of whom 1 ended up in hospital.
History of the Pride

June 28th 1969 the police raided the café Stonewall
Inn in New York City. This had happened before,
but this time the people at the bar stood up and
fought against the policemen that arrested some
of them for carrying clothes of the opposite gender
or for other minor reasons. The riots at Stonewall
gathered thousands of protestors on three nights
to fight for the rights of homosexuals, lesbians,
transvestites and transgenders. The following year
a march was arranged to remember the riots. From
those days on during summer the ‘HLBT community’
has celebrated so-called pride festivals around the
world.

Reykjavik Pride Festival
The sexual minorities of Iceland demonstrated their human rights in
Reykjavik on the Gay Pride festival 10th-13th of August. The event
culminated on Saturday 12th of August in a pride parade which draw
30.000 people to downtown Reykjavik.

Reykjavik Gay Pride, ‘Hinsegin Dagar’ (Different Days) has been
organised since 1999. The event has grown year for year. Five
organisations co-operate in arranging the event, the biggest of them is
Samtökk ‚78, an organisation for Icelandic lesbians and gay men founded
in 1978. The pride parade and outdoor concert on Saturday are the main
attractions of Reykjavik Gay Pride.

Thousands of people dress up in colourful costumes, or just as they
like, to walk down Laugavegur, the city’s main shopping street. Friends,
family, fellow citizens and many foreign visitors, cheer them. The parade
was opened by dykes on bikes, who were followed by carriers of the
rainbow flag, after them came floats: glamorous drag queens rounded
up with political messages, a big female dance group and men dressed in
leather.
The atmosphere was relaxed and cheerful.
Along the road people had lined with rainbow flags and other gayish gears to watch
the parade proceed. It looked like the whole town had come out this grey but luckily
not rainy day.
‘Seek out a cure’
That was not the whole truth; the same day there was an unnamed Christian coalition
that published a full-page ad in a newspaper encouraging homosexuals to „seek out a
cure for their disease“. A debate followed, where Icelandic health officials condemned
such rehabilitation attempts, and the Lutheran state church made sure to distance itself
from the coalition.
At the same time with the pride parade there was also a small anti-demonstration at
the central Ingólfstorg. Still a lot more people were gathering on Lækjargata where a
medley with Icelandic and foreign artists gave their input on the pride celebrations,
among the international guests were drag queens Ruth and Vigdis from Norway and


the band Shitting Glitter from the USA. In the end
everybody tuned up in the song of the day Gloria
Gaynor’s „I Am Who I Am“ in Icelandic „Ég er hvem
ég er“.
Love as pure love
During Reykjavik Pride I met a bunch of young
people from different countries willing to answer some
questions:
Jonas from Sweden thinks that people are born gay.
He has been to Stockholm Pride before and thought
there was better weather, but the show in Reykjavik
is wonderful, he adds singing along to a Carola song
performed by a drag queen on stage. The next question
makes him serious, about the aggression towards
people celebrating Pride in Riga. Jonas thinks that it‘s
frustrating that people can‘t see love as pure love.
Susie from the USA is selling Reykjavik Pride
bracelets and rainbow flags. She works as a volunteer
for Seeds, doing different things in Reykjavik. Susie
thinks humans should take an example of the sexual
variety among animals, because animals don‘t think in
terms of right and wrong. She says the attacks on Pride
festival in Riga was wrong, because people should be
able to celebrate what they want to.
Fun all along
Clemens from Germany feels like a pink elephant. He
feels he doesn‘t fit in among the people in Reykjavik,
but maybe he will feel comfortable when he gets
used to how people are in the city, because they mix
and mismatch their clothes and act differently than
Germans. Clemens thinks it’s interesting to see how
many crazy people have joined the Pride festival. He
38

thinks people in Reykjavik are more open-minded than
in central Europe and all people, even non-gay, have
fun all along.
Alice from Italy thinks the event was very well
organised and a lot of people in different ages joined.
This was the first time she saw the city full of people.
And she liked it.
