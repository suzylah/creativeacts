title: My dreams about you
---

Thinking about you all the time
I’m never to rest
Not that I mind
For I dream of the best
I find us flying over Asia
Walking imaginary lands
Beyond the borders of Fantasia
To whatever ends
Loving you
‘till the sands of time have flown
Touching you
Until our ancestors have grown
Impatient to the bone to hear
Our gossip, news and stories
Until humanity’s finally banned fear,
Feeling bad, and worries
Afraid of death does not exist
Only fear for pain of losing
That is whereof my dreams consist
And in the end, they keep me moving
