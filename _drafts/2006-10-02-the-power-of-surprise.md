title: The power of surprise
---

The unexpected breakfast in bed, the little gift out of the
blue, a stranger you meet in the streets and end up being
best friends with... but also a street robbery, a sudden
earthquake or being taken out of your bed and put in jail
because some people think you don’t belong somewhere.

Sometimes you like to be surprised, sometimes
you don’t and some people never want to be
surprised. One way or another, surprises have
a certain power to catch you off guard, when
you’re the most vulnerable.
Surprising someone in a positive way is a delicate thing.
You have to know the person well to estimate whether
your surprise is going to be appreciated. No fun in
spending hours and hours on a nice oven dish when the
only reaction you get is “but didn’t you know I’m allergic
to cheese?” In that case the one being unpleasantly
surprised is you. So know the interests but also the
(im)possibilities of the person you want to surprise. The
best thing is to require this information unnoticed by the
other. ‘Accidentally’ overhearing a conversation or just
asking his or her opinion on something in a casual way are
good examples to achieve this.
The next step is timing. No matter how much someone
likes to go on a survival/canoe trip, it’s probably not a
good idea to have the bags packed and ready on the moment he or she is just taken into the hospital for a big operation of some kind. So pick out a fitting time and place
for your surprise and the impact will be big and have the
wanted effect, as long as the person isn’t a surprise-hater
of course.
Million change
But what to do when you don’t have anyone around to
surprise although you really feel like it? The easiest thing
to do in that case is to surprise yourself and to look at the

world as one big surprise! Imagine being a child again
and seeing things for the very first time. Stop taking
everything for granted. Sometimes I just think of the
fact that it was a one in a million chance that I came into
this world and have become the person I am today in the
place I am right at that moment and I feel surprised with
life itself.
Be creative, look at the clouds and see how they can make
images with your dreams or thoughts. Be amazed by their
ever-changing movement of shape but still remaining
cloud! Always having a monster under your bed or a
clown in your closet might work for the more experienced
surpriser and bumping into yourself as you least expect
it is probably the best way to be surprised for a longer
period of time.
Strike
Some might think the above sounds kind of hippie like
but the power of surprise also has a downside. In the
same way as you can surprise someone in a positive way,
you can also turn it around and use it to hurt someone.
Knowing the enemy, especially the weak spot and finding
the right moment to strike are well known war tactics.
The time you need to realize what is going on before you
can act on the situation is the most dangerous. You’ll get
way behind on the person who planned the whole thing
and knows exactly what the next step will be. You have to
be a very creative and impulsive person to find a way out
of an unpleasant surprise. And that’s the advise I can give
you on how to avoid negative surprises: keep sharp and
keep up your level of improvising and creativity.
So concluding from all this ‘surprise’ goes far beyond
mere presents. It’s in every small thing that catches your
attention when you didn’t expect it. It’s about being open
towards it’s power, be aware but also let yourself be positively surprised!
