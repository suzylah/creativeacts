<p><span>Fit yourselves in small groups and choose one of the Provocation Technics for you to start on: wishful thinking, exaggeration, reversal, escape or distortion. For example, if you aim to engage more people for your student group, - reversal of reasons - why people would not join, can actually help to come up with points you would forget to think about before coming up with decision. Challenging the assumption that people should join at all - escaping it - can help to reveal new possibilities to do your things. </span></p>
<div><span>After a group of thinkers created a list of all these crazy provocations, most outlandish ones can be chosen to move forward to new ideas.</span></div>
