title: Adbusting what is it and where did it come from
---

Adbusters is an organisation based in Vancouver, Canada. It all started when a guy
named Kalle Lasn stood in a Canadian supermarket parking lot frustrated because he
had to insert a quarter into a cart to shop there. He jammed his quarter in so that the
cart became inoperable. This was his first “culture jam”.
This small step led to much bigger ones. In 1989, British Columbia’s forestry industry,
under attack by radical environmentalists, fought back with billboards and television
ads. Along with wilderness cinematographer Bill Schmalz and other activists, Lasn
launched a counter-ad. But television stations refused to air it. So the activists protested
in front of logging company headquarters and complained to the media. They garnered
press coverage, and the industry’s ads were pulled after hundreds of people phoned
the networks in support of the environmentalists. Exhilarated with their success, the
protesting cabal started the Adbusters Media Foundation.
Adbusters is also a magazine. In 1989 it was a quarterly magazine with 5000 copies, now
it’s a stunning bimonthly glossy with 120000 copies and readers in 60 countries. It’s a
magazine with critique on the society, articles ranging from weird art to „how-to-be-a-better-activist” and of course their famous spoof ads, in which they take on their hated
enemy, the multinational corporations.
The aim of Adbusters is to rid the world of the corporation by taking them on with
their own weapons. Marketing. Changing their ads into counter-ads, goryfying instead
of glorifying their products. Their campaigns, aimed at raising awareness about the
dangers of consumerism have become worldwide events. Buy Nothing Day, Turn Off
TV Week, events meant to get the people to think about the world they live in, and the
lives they live.
Adbusters have inspired many people to do actions, and to start their own kind
of adbusting campaigns, to change a world that they see as a world of greed and
destruction, ruled by ruthless corporations.
