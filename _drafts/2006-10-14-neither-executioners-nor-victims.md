Conscious objectors struggle in Greece
„Sergeant, Sir, I suffer from colour-blindness: I see each and every
target identical to my heart.“
Aris Alexandrou, Advice to an insubordinate (Poems 1941-1974)

We, the association of the Greek Conscious Objectors,
began a struggle, in the mid-‘80s, so that the possibility to
refuse military service for reasons of conscience would be
recognized in Greece, too. What in our country sounded
like an excessive demand of a tiny minority, in the
Western world was a self-evident right, constitutionally
guaranteed for every citizen, since the dawn of the 20th
century in some cases.
The objectors have been, and still are, going through an ordeal
with successive sentences by the military courts and many months
of imprisonment, systematic harassment and the intimidation
of their families by the police, denial of exiting the country, and
also restrictions: in practicing a profession, in acquiring personal
property, in exercising their right to vote, etc.
Despite all that, the number of declared objectors to military
service for reasons of conscience has expanded, slowly yet
steadily, activating to date several dozen opponents of violence and
militarism (Indeed, should one also count those invoking reasons of
religious conscience, the number rises to several thousand).

“We dared to take the decisive step.”

We are not attempting here to interpret the reasons why a significant
percentage of young people turn their back on military service. The
answer to this question is given from within each person subject to
military service before the critical moment of enlistment, with the
result that 1 in 4 never “wear a military uniform”

Decisive step

We are merely interested in speaking about our own
reasons and our personal motives. We dared to take the
decisive step and declared our refusal to enlist through
our public declaration, which we addressed to the media
and the competent recruitment services. Driven by our
moral principles, we declared our opposition to all forms
of violence –military or revolutionary, legal or illegal– and
refused our participation in the army, the foremost
machinery for the promotion of violence.
Our motive has not been the evasion of the ordeal of
the military service or any other petty self-interest. Our
motive is our ideological opposition to violence in any of
its forms, even when it is used for supposedly „pacifistic“
aims. Our motive is the international anxiety caused by
the expansionism of the superpowers, our opposition to the
escalation of warlike arms acquisitions, our disagreement to
the established ideology that acclaims the army to the status
of prerequisite for ensuring peace.
Our motive is our solidarity with the downtrodden
Greek and Turk breadwinner, who sees the fruits of
his/her daily toil being transformed into weapons of mass
mutual annihilation. Our motive is our opposition to the
machinations of Western imperialism that seeks the division
of humanity into Christians and heathens and, behind the
scenes, is cultivating new fronts for military confrontations.

Combating war

We are not merely uttering generalities in support of just
our struggle.
We are confronting imperialism in practice, struggling for
disarmament. We are confronting chauvinism in practice,

cooperating with the objectors of the neighbouring countries. We
are combating war in practice, refusing to serve it. And it is now
universally accepted that conscientious objection is a fundamental
component –if not the spearhead– of the peace movements.

lobotomy, as Archbishop Christodoulos has proposed in articles and
speeches. They direct their shots selectively to the conscientious
objectors, because the latter have the courage to manifest their
opposition to militarism and violence. They are not hiding, they are
not licking anybody‘s boots, they are not planning carefully how to
get transferred and they are not asking for favourable treatment or
a political favour.

“The United Nations, the Council of Europe,
the OSCE, the European Parliament, Amnesty International and a multitude of other distinguished organizations has for many years,
never ceased criticizing Greece for violating
the human right to conscientious objection.”

It is, after all, a fact that modern history has only praise to show:
for the 22,000 deserters and objectors of the German army during World
War II (15,000 of them were executed);
for the hundreds of French soldiers and the mass of people who supported
their refusal to strike on the Algerian liberators in 1961;
for the 110,000 who burned their draft cards, refusing to fight in the
imperialist U.S. war in Vietnam;
for the 111 professional American soldiers who deserted during the first
Gulf War;
for the 200,000 young men who refused to fight in the recent civil war in
Yugoslavia;
for the hundreds of American soldiers who sought political asylum in other
countries, sick from the annihilation of civilians in Iraq, during the last
three years;
for the dozens of Israeli soldiers who chose prison rather than becoming
accomplishes in crimes against civilian Palestinians;
for the 1,300 Israeli conscientious objectors in recent years (300 of those
during 2005);
for the 300,000 insubordinates by the count of the Turkish army (some of
those are declared conscientious objectors who suffered a lot in that country‘s
prisons).
The United Nations, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the
European Parliament, Amnesty International and a multitude of
other distinguished organizations has for many years, never ceased
criticizing Greece for violating the human right to conscientious
objection, welcomed as a step forward Law 2510/97 that provided
for „alternative service“. A newer legislative measure (Law
3421/05) did not remove any of the blatant injustices against the
objectors, did not remove the degrading provisions, neither did it
suspend prosecutions.

Hesitant

The political world stood hesitant towards the objector movement.
Grey crusaders of totalitarianism shamelessly demand the cruellest
punishment of conscientious objectors (some bigoted writers
have even demanded the death penalty) or their „treatment“ with
30

At the same time, these same crusaders are overlooking the masses
of the insubordinate -the ministry of Defence estimates their
number at 45,000- they are overlooking the suicides and fatal
accidents of soldiers, and they are overlooking the „discharges
without enlistment“ of the patriots of popular music halls and TV
shows.

Rally

Our voice has joined those of all anti-militarists of the planet. It
has become a petition, a protest and a rally with the demand that
the war on conscientious objectors must stop, that the prosecutions
and military trials must end. That a courageous step must be
made towards peace by decriminalizing conscientious objection,
by granting an amnesty to the older objectors who are being
saddled with repeated sentences, by rewarding the social role of the
“alternative service”.
War is a crime against humanity and militarism, as an executioner,
weaves the funereal shroud of its future victims. We do not
accept the role of the „executioner“, for which the venal heralds
of nationalism are seeking stooges, nor are we willing to aid and
abet future crimes against our neighbours or humanity. Neither do
we accept, however, the role of the „victim“ that the military and
religious intolerance have in store for us.
Conscientious objection is not only a universal human right; it is
also the ultimate refuge in order to save our individual dignity.
