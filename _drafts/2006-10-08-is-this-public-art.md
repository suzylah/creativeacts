title: Is this public art
---

“Very cool!” was my first thought. Last
February I saw huge memos stuck on big,
stately buildings in a main street in Madrid,
Spain. The memos stuck on the buildings just
said things like ‘don‘t forget to buy washing
powder’ or ‘call mum.’ My first idea was that
this was a piece of art. Some famous artist
probably?
Later, I started to doubt about it as being a
piece of public art. Could it be a commercial? I
didn’t notice a name of a company on it. Did I
know the letter type used on the memos? Did
the memos have a certain design that looked
like it belonged to some company, a mobile
phone provider’s house style for example?
Maybe the company wants me to be interested
in making more phone calls? Was it just a
commercial for a memo company?

I didn’t associate the design of the memos to
any company’s style I know, but does that
mean that these huge memos are actually
art and not commercials? I don’t think about
myself as a paranoid person, but I know that
the advertising world has dozens of tricks to
have products find their way into my mind,
to stimulate my likes subconsciously. Big
billboards in the streets are annoying more and
more people so of course advertising agencies
try and find different ways of influencing
people. Was this a new one?
I still don’t know. I don’t really care as well.
For me it felt that it stated that the city could
be your living room, so for me it was cool
anyway.
