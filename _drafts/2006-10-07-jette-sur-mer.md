*Jette by the sea*

In 1983, as part of an artistic project, a street
was turned into a beach by Wodek, a Polish
artist living in Jette (Brussels, Belgium). In the
weekend of June 10th and 11th, 23 years later, he
did it again and this time he also added water to
the beach!
For the official opening of a new exhibition
with 111 artists around the central theme ‚Sea‘,
he got permission (and sponsoring) from the
local authorities to flood part of a street under
a bridge and put a beach next to it. The story
behind this is that because of global warming,
the sea levels have risen and now Brussels is a
coastal city.

The ‚sea‘ was constructed by placing
rectangular plugs in the drains under the bridge
and then adding coloured water. The sides of
the tunnel were painted bright blue and yellow,
to suggest dunes, and sea sounds were played.
Next to the beach there was a shop that sold
buckets, beach balls and other beach stuff. And
if you went up the stairs (next to the gigantic
post card from Jette-sur-Mer 1983), there were
picnic tables, couches and of course Wodek
himself selling vodkas and snacks and of course
you could also enter the exhibition.
Because it was a very hot and sunny weekend
(30°C), a lot of people in bathing suits came to
the beach, and thus became part of this artwork.
