title: Food not Bombs
---

On Friday we collect all the left-over fruit and
vegetables at the local market. When we explain about
our action most people at the market are very willing
to cooperate. From a local bakery we get loafs of bread.
On Saturday we prepare the food into a hot vegetable
soup and fruit salad. We use a big kitchen in a local
squat. In the afternoon we hand out the meals in the
shopping centre area. Everybody that is interested
can join in eating with us. Also we had some flyers
available explaining the ideas of ‘food not bombs’ and
about animal rights specifically.
One of things I like most about this action is that you
can do it with (almost) no money and just a small
group of friends.
Food not Bombs is a worldwide movement (or a
loose-knit group of independent collectives, as stated
on a website) with people handing out free food as a
positive action against overconsumption, worldhunger
and (in our case) animal rights (by handing out
vegetarian/vegan food)
