title: Who’s street
---

*Opinion*

Wherever you go, you’re confronted with inhumanly good
looking men and women, who blind you with their snow
white teeth smile, make you go pale with the tint of their
skin or make you feel like an elephant by showing their
muscular non fat zero calorie bodies.
And they’re all trying to sell you something, like toothpaste,
liposuction, cars, bras, houses, life or insurance for it.
Preferably by making you feel unhappy.
Who gives them the space for that?
Our governments - our leaders - sell our streets to these
nasty corporations that want you feel too fat, ugly, unhappy
and wanting to buy stuff.
Your opinion on the street is illegal, it’s vandalism, because
you did not pay to have it on the street.
Your work of art, no matter if it’s graffiti, a sticker, poster
or a chalk painting on the pavement, it’s illegal, vandalism,
because you did not pay or got a license to be on that
street, in that tree, or on that wall.
You should have hired JCDecaux. This company has also
a view on beauty, as can be seen on their website, www.
jcdecaux.co.uk.
In 45 countries and 3500 cities they decide what the streets
look like, and get paid by the corporations to wash our
brain.
Some cities have special police squads that hunt those
terrorartists, who violently spread art and opinions on
the streets, radically beautifying the world without even
thinking about the positive effects this can have on the
common man in the street. Before you know they are

criticizing the government, the corporations and start
thinking for themselves, or worse even, not buying things
they don’t need!!! Luckily there are laws about that, so they
can fine those criminals or even put them in jail.
So, what about those adbusters?
Somewhere along the way, people decided that enough was
enough, that the streets were their streets as well, and that it
should be a place where you could walk freely, without being
confronted with sexist messages, environment destroying
car ads and corporate lies. The streets should instead be filled
with art and opinions instead of lies and deceit.
They started Adbusting.
Who are those mystical art terrorist mutants who come in
the middle of the night or day to “reclaim” those streets,
those billboards, trees and walls?
One example is a group on this site; www.ouvresa.tk
They have the key to the streets and are willing to share their
secret! Here, you can find how to make one yourself with
help of simple materials. Just open up those billboards and
hop, there you have a space for your own message, opinion
or work of art.
And well, wouldn’t you like that? To have your work hanging
safe and dry, where hundreds of people can see it?
Maybe it’s time to shove those advertisements up their
creative arses and the art on the street… Time to reclaim the
streets!
