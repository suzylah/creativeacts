<p>Asking “Why?” in a non-threatening way is the main idea of this method.</p>
<p>Finding out why something exists, why it is done the way it is. The result is a very clear understanding of “Why?” which naturally leads to fresh new&nbsp; ideas. The goal is to be able to challenge anything at all, not just&nbsp; items which are problems. For example, one could challenge the handles on coffee cups. The reason for the handle seems to be that the cup is often too hot to hold directly. Perhaps coffee cups could be made with insulated finger grips, or there could be separate coffee cup&nbsp; holders similar to beer holders.</p>
