DISCUSSION:

Frans: No logo activism or creative activism?

Activism sells. Activists of today rebel against big brands and logos by carrying around their own brands and logos. But wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt is as much being a fashion victim as wearing Prada. ‚Activism’ has become a
highly commercialised lifestyle; in which the image of being
‚authentic‘ and ‚against the system‘ is used as an effective
means for companies to brand and sell their products.
What can an activist do about this? A lot of activists choose
the negative option: to fight the system, the logos, the
brands and the corporations. But if you really want to be
an anarchist activist, you should get loose of your black
and red icons, and choose for the no-logo way. That means
in practice: never leave a name! You can just start your
no logo actions by doing things that are not in any way
organized or could end up in another form of branding your
name/logo, spreading an image, or even as a use for your
artistic activities, art school, etc. You just go out and be
spontaneous, play and change the world around you without
any more effect than just what you do. Don‘t take pictures.
Your actions should just be as they are. Anonymous,
creating small moments of humanity in the streets. It is fun
to do, but your ego will not like this too long. Most activists
are not enlightened Buddhists. Some moment you want to
be noticed or seen, or have a result. So you better leave the
‚negative‘ section and join the positivists.
Creative activism is to create your own alternatives, your
own media, your own images and ‚activist branding‘. You
go out in the streets, start your own media, and spread
your own ideas and images. You will create a whole world
of imagination. And your imagination can grow into new
forms of reality. Another world is possible when you create
it. So, one day you will find yourself selling T-shirts, black
spot shoes, magazines and activism gadgets for an interesting
target group of highly educated, critical world citizens.
This is just what you should do. Creative activism is about

creating alternatives. If your ideas and actions become a
success, you have to deal with the effects. This is a big
problem for a lot of revolutionaries. It is easier to fight the
negative than to realize the positive. But it is worth a try.
And maybe one day you will rule the world with your
creative activism media empire. Do not doubt, just make it
happen.

Marc: Why should activism be creative?

You ask the question, ‚why should activism be creative?‘. I
think this is an important question. I would say that activism
should be creative, because creativity implies the ability to
find new ways or new forms of making things happen. It
can change reality. In your article you say that it is easier to
be negative than to formulate the positive alternative. Being
an activist alone, one won‘t find new, positive ways; being a
creative activist, one is making them.

Doeko: Is creative activism innovative?

Is creative activism innovative? I would say yes and no
at the same time. Not every new idea will be considered
innovative since sometimes it is too close to clichés or just
doesn’t have enough new elements in it. Sometimes it can
be the opposite, namely too many new elements and then
people will not consider it as innovative but will probably
see you as a weirdo.
Old ideas can be considered as innovative if their context
is innovative. Spreading a poster in a town where no one
has ever done it, is that creative activism? I would say yes,
for me it’s not about constantly inventing ideas no one ever
thought of but more about putting ideas in the right context
and by doing that make them innovative.

Frans: Should activism be creative or innovative?

Activism is a way of living in which you actively engage you
with the world you live in. One could say being an activist
is the opposite of not caring about the world around you, and just living your own life. Should you be creative or
innovative to be a ,good’ activist? No, but of course it makes
a difference if you put something old and stereotyped or
something entirely "new" and creative into the world.
Creative activism is the mix of 1) engaging yourself actively
with the world you live in, and 2) using the sources of
imagination, creativity and inspiration to give form to the
world around you; resulting in forms of creative expression.
Should an activist always be creative? No, sometimes you
don’t need to be creative, sometimes a stupid, simple action
that is done a thousand times is enough. Context is imortant,
street art in Berlin is less innovative than street art in
Mongolia. So what about going there next summer...

Marc: Anybody been in Mongolia?

Hmm, that makes me quite curious about activism in
Mongolia. Possibly, common forms of activism in that
country could be very creative when placed in Berlin...
Anybody been in Mongolia?
Apart from creating alternatives, creativity also helps to get
the message of your action through to the public. Creativity
effects the people’s imagination, their feelings and their
thoughts.

Doeko: Uncle Sam

I think that in many countries the use of street theatre
would be seen as creative activism but I think just the use of
theatre isn‘t always creative. Often you see that clichés such
as ‘Uncle Sam’ (carrying around a big image of Uncle Sam
during anti-US or anti-war actions) are being used and that
has been done many times but again maybe not in that place
on earth.

Marc: Creative actions

I agree that stuff like street theatre or dressing up in some
way for a demo (like Uncle Sam or Robin Hood) is not very
innovative, though the question was raised before whether
creative activism should be always innovative.
A key word could be imagination. Creative actions like
street theatre trigger my imagination and my emotions.
Especially when the image is new for me. Uncle Sam doesn‘t
do that to me anymore. Therefore it is, in my opinion, not
very creative. Creative actions should be doing something
new, for their context of course. I use the word ‚innovative‘

for raising new images and statements as well as for new
forms of action.

Frans: Creative imagination

So it is not about being innovative or not, but about the
question: are you using your creative imagination? Do you
only react on what is happening or do you take the time to
fly around the situation, see it from different perspectives,
and imagine how it could be, how you would like it to be?
Yesterday I had a discussion with my neighbour about
what is a good way of being active in society. He said it is
most important to be practical, to realise things in practice.
I agreed, but added it is also important to connect the
practical action with reflection and imagination. Only
creative imagination would make the world flow away into
pink clouds, only practical action misses a good idea, and a
sense of what is happening, a sense of reason.
For a good action you need to reflect over the situation,
fly around the subject and research your motives to do
something with it; to use your creative imagination; and
to act in practice. Acting in practice should contain more
than just publishing or spreading your ideas, but somehow
include realizing your ideas.

Joep: Creative tactics

No one is original. The best anyone could possibly do, is
to disorder and reorder existing thoughts, images, sounds.
Creativity is not more or less then a productive search for
new combinations.
Creative activism is about activities that rebel in one way
or another but escape the usual image of activism. Aren‘t
you getting tired as well by yet another strike? By another
protest march? These forms of activism are easy to neglect:
media and politicians have developed effective strategies
to cope with them. Creative activism should pose a new
challenge to the powers we contest (including numbing
routine and ecological waste), to create space for change by
making oppositional forces immune to easy refusal.
So, it‘s not only fun, creative activism a necessary tactic.
