title: Has the web really helped you to get somewhere
---

Of course you don’t want to travel only in the summer holidays. But
who has the money to travel and meet friends abroad more often than
that? Fortunately, you are not dependent on expensive travel agencies
to have a good time abroad. Skip the commercial ways. You can do
it yourself in a creative way! A weekend for a city trip, a year on
the road? Why not hitchhike to your local Hospitality Club-member
and enjoy? This way you travel in a cheap, adventurous and possibly
environmentally friendly way. Here is how.
Hitchhiking

Don’t take an expensive train ticket or a polluting plane. Don’t sweat
for hours in a crowded coach. Also possible is: hitch-hiking!
Hitchhiking is fun. You meet many different kinds of people, listen
to their stories and you can tell your own. You’ll get to the most
bizarre spots, you’ll be offered a place to sleep, and make new
friends. It’s also for free.

Tip. Travel from gas station to gas station. At gas stations you can

ask people personally if you can drive with them and you see with
whom you get into a car.

Tip 2. Take a decent map with you, then you know where the gas
stations are and where you’re sort of heading towards.
Plan your hitchhike

When you want to be assured of a ride, the internet might be able
to help you out. There are several sites on which drivers look for
co-passengers who want to join them for a little money. Especially
in Germany this method is very popular. The advantage is that you
kind of know whom you’re travelling with (everybody is registered
and you have their phone numbers). Disadvantage is that it costs
46

you a little money. To compare: travelling this way from
Amsterdam to Berlin will cost you 15-25 euros. By train this
ride will cost you around 70 euros. A well-known Dutch site is
www.hitchhikers.org. Here you can only offer rides and react
to other offers. Very often it’s long distance rides from one
side of Europe to the other side of Europe. In Germany www.
mitfahrgelegenheit.de is used a lot. Together there are over a
million people involved and the sites offer lots of international
rides. Check the web for more local sites.

Your network

If you think the things above are too adventurous or dangerous,
then you could also look for a ride in your surroundings. Maybe
you’ve got a truck driver in your family or among friends. Apart
from that many more people go on holiday of course. Maybe
they’ve got a free spot in their car, which you could fill. Or
perhaps somebody is driving to the other side of the country for
their work or so and they would like to have some company on
their way there. Think about where the people around you go to
and ask if you could ride with them. You may well be surprised
about how many people you know and where they go.

Accommodation

Youth hostels are getting more and more expensive. For (wild)
camping the weather should be okay. Approaching a boy or
girl in a disco every night in order to have somewhere to sleep
will get tiring quickly. A nice solution is joining the Hospitality
Club.
What is the Hospitality Club?

The aim is to bring people together - hosts and guests,
travellers and locals. Thousands of Hospitality Club
members around the world help each other when they
are travelling - be it with a roof for the night or a guided
tour through town. Joining is free; everyone is welcome.
Members can look at each other‘s profiles, send messages
and post comments about their experience on the website
www.hospitalityclub.org.
The club is supported by volunteers who believe in one
idea: by bringing travellers in touch with people in the
places they visit, and by giving ‘locals’ a chance to meet
people from other cultures, they can increase intercultural
understanding and strengthen the peace on our planet.
Which is a good thing, isn’t it?

“I see real friendships and strong bonds
developing across borders”
“I am 21 years old and member of the Hospitality Club (HC) now for two
and half years. For an exchange year I live in Brussels, Belgium, though
I study English and French in university in Berlin, Germany. Next to
hosting and visiting people, I do voluntary work for the HC like updating
geographical data when people misspell their home town and also insert
the data for our map on Google online.” Martin Jähnert (Germany)
How did you get in contact with HC?
“I was searching for tips on hitch-hiking, because I wanted
to surprise a friend in Estonia and go through Poland and the
Baltics ‘by thumb’. The founder of HC, Veit Kuehne, has done
a lot of hitch-hiking, and from his site I got to HC - then I just
met him for a small chat on his experiences and used HC for
the trip to the Baltics... It worked perfectly well, I met so many
great people on the road and in their homes - the only one who
wouldn‘t let me stay at her place, was my old friend, and a
member of HC saved me...”
Can you tell me something more about the ideas behind HC?
“HC tries to promote different goals - another way of travelling;
the exchange of ideas, knowledge and good vibes between
people from different backgrounds, not only geographically and
politically, but also in sense of socialisation and age; the spread
of intercultural connections hopefully prevents people from
fighting against each other. And, of course, it is a way to make
travelling for backpackers easier, nicer, and also affordable for
people who don‘t have a big cash-machine in the basement.”
So, do-it-yourself-globalisation?
“For sure, HC helps the globalisation... but it also tries to
improve its impacts. In the end it‘s about the members, who
are forced to self-organise. The exchange happens personto-person, that means, nobody tells you „this is your host“ or
anything like that.
HC itself has become really big now, 200.000 members, a vast
amount. Still, it keeps its structures: it‘s all for free, and all
run by volunteers. It will keep on growing, but it is important
not to lose the mind about the numbers: What counts are the

small experiences, a new word in a foreign language you learn, be
it przepraszam (Polish, excuse me), multumesc (Rumanian, thanks),
or ni hao (Mandarin, hello). The hidden beach or valley a local host
helps you discover. A warm smile and a hot soup after a long travel
to a place you‘ve never seen before.”
Is HC a new phenomenon?
“The internet provided new ways of communication. HC uses the
possibilities of the web very effectively. HC doesn’t stand alone. There
are different other organisations with similar goals, certainly. Other
hospitality networks are the ‘ancestor’ SERVAS, in which people are
invited through postal letters. On line are the smaller ‘competitors’
like the Couch surfing-project or Global Free Loaders.”
How do you know if it’s safe to host a stranger via HC?
“Basically safer than other cheap ways of travelling. It’s common to
ask for the passport number of the member in the first mailing contact,
and verify it when (s)he arrives. I check the comments before I host, if
there are strange comments, I do not host. And I also give comments
to the point, so the next member that is asked for accommodation
will be able to judge whether to host the particular member or
not. This leads to very few incidents, every member knows: bad
behaviour leads to bad comments, and this again to isolation, to not
being accepted as guest or asked for accommodation.”
What’s the thing that appeals most to you in HC?
“I like that friendships are developing across borders. The background
of the people stays interesting, but becomes less important than
his actual ideas and his being. Everywhere around me I see real
friendships developing, strong bonds between the members in one
city or region and another. They are meeting up wherever they can.
There are just so many people with a similar spirit.”
Anything more you want to say?
“Join! At the moment I am reading Von Schönburg’s „Die Kunst des
stilvollen Verarmens“ (The art of how to become poor while keeping
the style), a nice book trying to show that money isn‘t the key to the
joy of life. And on every page where he describes people with an
adorable lifestyle, I feel reminded of many different HC members.”

“HC taught me to trust people more. Before I was surprised how people trust strangers
and just give them keys to their place the first time they see them, but now I do the
same. Sometimes I have a feeling that it became kind of a lifestyle for me. I guess the new
lifestyle changed me in a positive way :) It made me more trusting, open-minded, easygoing
and spontaneous. HC is just a very ‘friendly’, sociable and exciting way of travelling.”
(Ieva Grumbinaite, Lithuania, member for 2,5 years)
“There are thousands of members, it’s just great... to
think about all those people and how they meet each other around the world... And there
are just all kinds of people with all kind of backgrounds, everyday lives and future plans.
Different home streets and favourite places. People from all ages, whole families... My last
guest was a Slovenian guy who was biking around the world in five years. I’ve visited
students, different kinds of families, couples, communes. Every meeting has left a trace in me,
and many warm memories were engendered. The HC idea in practice has shaped my world
view and conception of the human being, although sometimes it’s also confusing to see how
the location in the world & political situation of a given state effect the thoughts of a single
person, in a positive way.”
“ R e m e m b e r,

dating service, even though the slogan is:
„Bringing people together“. Though,
don‘t feel guilty if you happen to find
your true love through the club... I
didn‘t mean to!”
(Linda Kuha, Finland, member
for 2,5 months)
“Most people who
sign up for a community like HC
share a natural open-mindedness and curiosity, a willingness to
share and a very appealing freedom from prejudices. Staying with such people when being out
travelling usually gives a much deeper experience than just hanging around in some hostel with
other backpackers. The chance to stumble onto something interesting and getting in touch with the
local flavour of a place increases vastly by meeting people from the area where you are staying. Also,
it is nice to have guests from all over the world coming by to stay at your place and
be able to share your local reality with them.”
“Me and
(Magnus Löfqvist, Sweden, member for 2 years)
my husband travelled
to Italy this summer. Our artistic hosts
have inspired me in many ways. All of them have really
shared a piece of their cultural heritage with us. I really loved the creativity
of my Italian hosts, because even though Italy has a rich cultural tradition it is very difficult
to create innovative initiatives (Italy is comparatively conservative and for some it is hard
to find a job). All of our hosts have actually succeeded in one way or another to develop such
initiatives, one arranged a lot of local activities, such as moonlight movie night, the other
one had a jazz jam session for HC members, the third one a discussion theatre workshop.
One by one they set examples of the next generation of cultural creatives.”
