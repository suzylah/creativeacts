title: Positivity works
---

Grandmothers, multi-nationals, writings on toilet walls, they
say it all the time: ‘be positive and you’ll get most out of life’,
‘don’t worry, be happy’, ‘just do it’, or one of the other million
sayings… So let’s be honest, it’s rather cliché to state that
positivity works.
But it does.

What is actually the benefit of being positive or doing
something positive?
I think positivity works because it’s appealing to the ones
exposed to it. A positive thought or sight can tickle you, inspire
you or make you smile. It is a constructive attitude, it stimulates
progression towards the better.

Let us believe the maximum of positivism, then everything is
possible. Our thoughts would be borderless. Our imagination
could create anything. And even if we would realize only half of
that, what a creative boost this would be!

It can even be seen as a continuing spiral. I just mentioned
creativity coming out of positivism, but it can be turned around
as well. You can gain positivity by being creative, by finding out
that you can see possibilities and are capable of realizing them
(the so-called Hey! I Can Do This!-Moment).

POSItivity: looking at / for possibilities
CREAtivity: seeing possibilities and ways to realize them
REAlization: turning ideas into reality

The so-called Hey! I Can Do This!-Moment is great. I’d
recommend it to anybody who likes to contribute to reality.
