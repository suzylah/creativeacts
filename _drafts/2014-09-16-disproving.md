<p><span>Place yourselves in smaller groups (3-5 people) and your minds in state of thinking </span><span>that the majority is always wrong. Your task is to take anything that is obvious, generally accepted as "goes without saying" and question it. Take an opposite view, and try to convincingly disprove it.</span> When the group feels finished with the exercise make a round to sum up conclusions.</p>
