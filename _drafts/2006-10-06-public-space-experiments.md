title: Public Space Experiments
---

We created a series of time machines in public space.
Time machines can bring you wherever you want, if their
construction is good. As we forgot to keep them going, we
lost track on them. But what happened with by-passers,
who accidentally got thrown into another era? Street art is
something temporary, stupid! We left our traces and went
on.

We found ourselves a way of brainstorming with objects
in public space. Important is that you donâ€™t prepare; you
just do what you feel like. You look around in the city as if
everything is your material. You look especially to objects
that are loose: trash, a note, a bike tire. You search for
ways to re-create what you found. With these actions, you
change the meaning of objects in public space.
The act is simple, but effective. Playful and without
pretensions. You bring a bunch of prefixed images and
texts, a letter gun, tape and some old magazines. You
go into town and find yourself a good spot. It could be
an electricity box or a piece of trash. You create it into
something fantastic. Important is, that you create it 3-D.
A lot of street art is two dimensional, flat, as a drawing
or text. This action is different: you are not writing on
the wall, but changing the meaning of space. Your objects
turn into something else. They become a time machine,
a central post for urban communication, a temporary art
exhibition or a hanging garden. Just in five minutes, you
created something new and authentic. You walk on. Maybe
it is gone next week, but the magic has had its effect. Of
thousand by-passers, one should have been touched. And
by the way, did you create just to impress? Important
of your action was, that you changed the meaning of
the world around you, you found yourself a new way of
interacting with your environment. You are no longer a
passive consumer of public space, but a creative actor. It
gives you a magical feeling. Now just play on.
