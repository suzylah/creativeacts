Do we want everybody
to conquer back the streets?
Since I met Loesje* 1½ years ago, I started noticing art in the streets. Suddenly
there were all these posters, stickers, graffiti and stencils around me. I
live in Berlin and this is a very creative city. In certain areas you feel even
overflooded by impressions. I like to walk through the streets and look around
and be aware of this other kind of life. There are so many interesting ideas
and you get very inspired. If you walk with open eyes, of course.
I think that -like me for a long time- a lot of people don’t see any street art.
This makes me question how effective street art is actually? Does the art or
the message reach people? Does it reach only a certain group? Not everybody
meets Loesje to open his or her eyes.

“I surely do not
want to see racist
and fascist slogans
on my way to the
tube station.”

* Loesje is a girl who
likes to stick her and her
friends´ own posters all
around the world.*


For me street art is a nice way for people to express themselves. You can see
the same methods all around the world, sometimes even the same thoughts
or similar ideas. Sometimes it is very specific how people in one culture
express themselves through street art and then it’s very different from other
places. It is interesting to see this. This is a reason why I like street art to be
around.
Racist slogans
For me there is one problematic thing with street art: if the streets are public
space and I am free to use them for my right of freedom of expression and
put art and posters on the streets – this includes that everybody has that
right. „Everybody“ means also people that put art or messages in the street
that I really dislike. For example, I surely do not want to see racist and fascist
slogans on my way to the tube station.
Besides, if everybody were allowed to express themselves on the streets it
would create a public dialogue. Which is not bad. But couldn’t it also end up
in the misuse of public space? In a mess?
I haven’t found an answer to these questions yet. They come up in my mind
from time to time. I like to stick posters and stickers – but I am careful with
myself to want to „conquer back the streets“.
What do you think?
