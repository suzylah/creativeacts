<p>Paulo Freire is a Brasilian educator and philosopher who is a leading advocate of critical pedagogy. He is well know for his influential work, 'Pedagogy of the Oppressed' which is considered one of the fundational texts of the critical pedagogy movement. While working, Freire became aware of the economic, political, and social domination resulting from paternalism. Paternalism leads to a culture of silence, which keeps people from confronting their oppression. He turned this philosophy to pedagogy because “the whole education system was one of the major instruments for the maintenance of this culture of silence.” One of Freire’s central tenets was that “education is freedom” that leads toward true liberation and that the “banking” concept of education- where students are empty vessels to be filled, acts as an instrument of oppression.</p>
<p>His philosophy on education centers on critical consciousness, where the oppressed recognize the causes of their oppression “so that through transformative action they can create a new situation, which makes possible the pursuit of fuller humanity.” He introduced problem-posing education; this type of education, in opposition to banking education, involves “listening, dialogue and action” and is an instrument that leads people to grow their consciousness and to social transformation.</p>
<p>His work, theory and concepts have influenced lots of people to action and social transformation.<br>
