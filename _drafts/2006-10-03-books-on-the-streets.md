title: Books on the streets
---

*Imagine you are walking on the streets and instead of
seeing posters hanging on electricity boxes you see books
hanging there. That’s what some friends and I did last
summer in the city of Arnhem, the Netherlands.*

On the World Press Freedom Day May 3rd 2006 we created a
book in 1 day with over 500 people, with freedom of expression
as main topic. These books had to be distributed. From the post
office we got these plastic bags to put custom documents in that
you can stick on the outside of packages that you want to send.
We had too many of them and I put a book in it.

The book fitted perfectly in the bag and I made a joke that we
could put up books in public spaces to spread them. I walked
outside to test if the plastic bag would hold on an electricity box
and it did. An hour later, books were hanging in different crazy
places for people to take home.
A day later several books were still hanging. Maybe people didn’t
dare to take them home? I will say that it looked funny.

Do it yourself

If you, too, want to try such an action, you can go to the post
office (at least in the Netherlands) and say that you want to send
packages abroad and need those plastic envelopes that stick on the
outside. They will give you as many as you want for free and on
the back of the bag you just have to remove the paper and it will
stick on many surfaces without damaging it.
It’s an easy action and fun to do. Especially watching how other
people react is great!
