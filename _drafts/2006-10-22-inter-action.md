This is how it’s done. First you find a theme, a
subject of the action. You see something happening in
your neighbourhood or on the news or it’s a special
celebration day that provides the theme. But you
can also just feel the need to bring a certain subject
forward that you think is important to discuss or let
people think about. Then: do the action.
When you have a theme you have to decide what you want
to do with it. What reactions do you want to get from people,
what do you want to say with your street action?
You can start a brainstorm on how to put this subject in the
streets in a positive or provocative way. If you just want to
inform people about a situation, it may be a good idea to spread
some flyers but if you think this theme needs a surprising
effect you can think of a more creative way of attracting the
attention of your audience.
Gifts
For example, spreading little gifts related to the subject
with some explanation on or with it. You can use figurative
expressions and take them literally by personating them in the
streets. With living statues or street theatre you can also easily
get the attention of passers by. Do make sure your message is
as clear as you want it to be. If people don’t understand what
you are doing, they aren’t likely to remember what they have
seen. Unless it’s so remarkable and weird that it totally blows
them off their feet of course.
And then, when you get to the place to be, where it’s all going
to happen, make sure everyone knows what he or she is doing
to get the best result. But the most important thing of all is to
have loads of fun doing it! If you are enthusiastic, you can get
other people thrilled and influenced by your positivism.

“Put a living statue about consumerism
in the middle of a shopping street on a
crowded Saturday and it certainly won’t
go unnoticed!”

The good thing about actions in the street is that people
can come up to you and ask what you are doing and you
are able to make your statement stronger. You have direct
interaction with people on the street. You can ask their
opinion and start good discussions. You can also make a
statement that people won’t easily overlook. Put a living
statue about consumerism in the middle of a shopping
street on a crowded Saturday and it certainly won’t go
unnoticed!
So just take your ideas out into the streets, start small, keep
it simple. Try new ways of getting people’s attention and
play with anything you walk into. Why keep your right to
remain silent?
