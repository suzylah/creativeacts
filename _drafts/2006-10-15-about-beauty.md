*Opinion*

Gorgeous guys on television, the new lipstick, a Porsche, a work of art,
beauty can be found in a lot of things. Picture perfect living rooms full
with feng shui candles. Plastic surgery. A dog’s wardrobe.

For many years all have been working towards beauty. Beauty
being a state in which the largest amount of people finds the object
beautiful. What is this human craving for beauty, what’s wrong
with ugly things. Why, even in the ugly, we look for beauty?
To get to know more about our craving for beauty, we should first know
how beauty is defined. Is there a definition of beauty?
No, there isn’t. Beauty is an opinion and the verdict lies in the eyes of the
beholder.
Various people find various things beautiful.
When first seeing work by Erwin Olaf, a photographer, the first thing
that came up in my mind was, “this is beautiful”. The very picture was
of a little boy, pale and white, stabbed in the back and blood coming out
of the wound. The picture was very aesthetic. No scream of horror. While
others seemed to be shocked by this work, I really loved it. It wasn’t the
beauty of a top model or something really trendy, but it was the pure
power of the picture.
Should you look at cultural backgrounds to define beauty? I think you
should. In some cultures beauty is fat woman, long necks, stretched lips,
colourful artwork and big woven rugs on the wall. In other cultures these
things are looked upon as being ugly.
But even though there are cultural differences, they can also change
during the years.
Since the boom of plastic surgery and the large increase of art-school
students it seems that beauty is something good, the greatest good to
conquer.
Even though not everyone agrees, making yourself more beautiful gives
you better chances to perform well, be better paid and even have better

sex, a newspaper survey proved sometime ago.
So your urge for beauty would also increase your living standards. At least
in the Western world, where the western values rule.

Size D

People are willing to pay high prices for beauty, but how do they know
that they are buying the right beauty?
Examples are given to us everyday in overpriced fashion magazines,
television and other media. Even though you would think that beauty
is fed to us through these media, they actually have the people as their
source.
It’s like a chain reaction, one person acts or wears something someway,
another person digs that and all of a sudden it’s a hit. Trends are also the
victim of time, same as beauty.
In the 90’s there was this huge desire to get a boob job, and size D was
considered a small one. But with the turn of the century more and more
women are saying goodbye to their implants. That makes you wonder
if in the end, let’s say twenty years from now, that all those people that
are now having painful and expensive operations will have wasted it all
because that beauty doesn’t apply to them any longer.
And then one of the bigger questions is how it comes that a lot of people
see the same things as being beautiful. There are big differences even in
the same culture. So who tells what is beautiful, who sets the trend? We
do not have one point of view. People have different tastes and prefer
other stuff. Unity doesn’t exist in beauty either.

“The very picture was of a little boy,
pale and white, stabbed in the back,
and blood coming out of the wound.
The picture was very aesthetic.”

Meaning

Many say that young people are beautiful. Then, how does it come that it
fades during the years. I guess it’s not the people that are beautiful, but
the fact that they’re young.
What I’m trying to point out is that beauty cannot be defined, not even
by the opinion of the majority even though marketing managers and the
fashion world might be trying to tell you different. While walking down
the street you may regard things as being beautiful, but in many ways. By
handcraft, technique, appearance or impact, by meaning or fabric. There
is not one kind of beauty.
But one thing is a fact. Beauty for many is on the outside.
