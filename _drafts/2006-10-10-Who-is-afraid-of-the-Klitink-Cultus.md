title: Who is afraid of the Klitink Cultus
---


Klitink is a living and revolting machine, in constant state of revolution, continuously
expanding itself in the vast desert surroundings called modern society. Exploring the
immense subconscious with vehicles beyond comprehension, logging dreamscapes,
mindshades and bliss-like chimeras, Klitink’s sole purpose is to open up the portal
to an introspective world, creating a surreal expression of visual poetry. This is a
summary of the thoughts and the theories of Klitink.

Manifesto of Klitink

Clitinc/Klitink did a public action, in the city of Breda,
the Netherlands. Like most larger cities nowadays,
the city-centre is filled with surveillance camera’s, and
actions against them.
Public area means that it’s open for general public, no
exceptions made. Since the city centre is called “public
area”, you can question if it’s really that open, because
you’re constantly being watched. Of course, the
reason is for the safety of the general public.
But why are people feeling unsafe? It’s not that the
public area is the most crime-related area of the city.
Au contraire! If compared with other regions in the
suburbs, the city centre is pretty damn safe!
When entering the public area, you are notified of the
hidden surveillance cameras by numerous warning
signs. With semiotics in mind, these signs, instead of
reassuring the general public, create a form of fear.
The subconscious will relate these signs with possible
crime: “There is camera-surveillance in this area.
Camera-surveillance prevents crime, hence in this area

20

there is crime, because otherwise there would be no
need for camera surveillance.”
But who’s watching? Maybe this is the beginning of
George Orwell’s 1984?
Maybe big brother is secretly gathering information
on all of us, researching our life-pattern, our habits,
our culture; and sells that information to grand-capital
megalomaniac multi-galactical business centres? Maybe
there’s some secret voyeuristic underground commune
with big bucks to spend, who gets turned on by it,
which result in strange orgies including elephants?
Overnight during some normal week, a group of
3 people, loaded with heavy-duty glue, industrial
double-sided sticky tape and cut-to-size warning
signs went out to the “public area”. They followed
their predetermined route changing all the “camerasurveillance” warning signs in the area with their ownmade. After that night, instead of the city of Breda, the
Klitink cultus was watching over you. You feel much
safer now, don’t you?

his text derived out of pure necessity,
for modern day life is a life completely
subservient to the mass - production
and consumption - society.
The streets are covered with
propaganda-like
advertisements,
extolling
over-reproduced
unnecessities, the fashion-shops are
filled with uniform mass-fabricated
products, the music industry is
undifferentiated where every tune
sounds the same as the tune before,
even if you compare different styles or
genres, and every TV-channel brings
you the same pre-rendered formula,
a consistency of the same general
programs.
The mainstream culture absorbs these
given guidelines without a moment of
consideration.
And the sub-cultures just follow
along, to fit in a certain type of pigsty.
Everybody adapts to the group they
want to belong, adjusts to the dress
code and social intercourse of that
particular group but still proclaiming
that they do not adapt, that they are so
different from the mainstream culture.
Like pigs in mud they are, digging and
digging, deeper and deeper into this
mess.

We will not adapt to these
external requirements of
mass-society, but we choose
to stay faithful to our internal

cravings of the individual. We
turn our back to the mainstream society
with their uniform lifestyle, we laugh at the
pitiful sub-cultures for their ignorance.
Because of this, society
will label us as a rebellious
confederacy, and for some part, this

is true. We choose our own individual path,
instead of the pre-rendered path of masssociety or subcultures, and because of this,
it is hard to fit in to society’s standards.
If this is considered rebellious, so be it.
15
We are
active on spreading our thoughts
and theories, we are constantly plotting
against issues we do not agree on, we are
trying to open some long closed eyes, and
because of this, we collide with society’s
standards.
If this is considered a confederacy, so be
it.
Throw away this rigid, strict lifestyle that ties
you down, tear off this mass-produced skin
that hides your individuality, and dare to
live a free life -your own life- without the
piercing pressure of an antique archaistic
society.

We will burn every single
page of this manifesto at the

moment it becomes outdated, and replace
it with a brand-spanking new and improved
one, that suites the spirit of the time. We
will not be conservative about our own
opinions, in fact, we are willing to let go
every single assumption, if other opinions
proof to be more suitable, and therefore
beat the crap out of ours. We keep an
open mind.

Klitink officiates as a sanatorium, as a
sanctuary, as a moment of contemplation.

We have killed the inventor
and flushed his notes,

destroyed his laboratory, and raised
Klitink in the air as a newborn baby. We
have thrown away our blinding blinkers
in order to be exposed to the magnificent
world surrounding us, we have burned
the premeditated maps so we can travel
freely into the unknown, all in favour
of the experience. We glorify the
childhood state, in which everything
is new, where a whole wide world lies in
front, ready to be explored and nothing is
taken for granted.
In Klitink, everything is as much right
and wrong, as it is not. We live for the
experience.
We love dynamics, we love flexibility!
We do not want to be bound to one
working manner, we do not want to be
tied up to one style, we do not want to be
placed in one sheep-pen with a label stuck
in our ear.
We are interchangeable, we are dissolute,
we are inscrutable, we are wrong, we are
right, we are left, we are unexpected, we
are boundless, we are countless, we are
incorruptible, we are rash, we are highly
low-budget, we are unquestionable,
we are desultory, we are art and we are
artless, we are a harsh sounding device in
a soundproof booth, we are the antidote
for the disease we are, and most of all,

we are not welcome at other
peoples parties.
