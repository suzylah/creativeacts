title: Public space in Minsk – commercialised dictatorship
---

Minsk is a designer’s paradise. After the city was almost completely destroyed
during World War 2, the designers of Stalin and consorts had free reign to rebuild
Minsk into a model city according to modern soviet standards. There are broad
streets, big squares and grave, stiff designed buildings, dressed up with red stars,
hammers and sickles. The soviet architecture is pompous and megalomaniac but
has its own, absurdistic charm. The metro stations are stylish and seem to be
designed for a science fiction movie. Recently, the city of Minsk has been filled
with big flat screens on public squares and in the metro system. Short films
and spots push the people to consume and obey. In the metro stations you find
hypermodern flat screens that present a mix of commercials for Marlboro mixed
with cartoons and clips to support an ‘orderly society’. Roofs of big buildings are
covered with big brand labels like VW, Siemens or Nokia. And this is probably
only the beginning, because there are not yet that many shops to be found.

A wet dream for control freaks, but a nightmare for the
ones that love freedom. The streets in Minsk contain a
bizarre mix of symbols of communistic dictatorship and
capitalistic consumerism. Communistic icons, state
propaganda and commercials for international brands
go hand in hand, as if they were good old comrades.
Lenin watches over your MacDonald’s hamburgers.

The streets in Minsk are clean. National Cleaning Day is only one of several ways
in which the state keeps the streets clean. Graffiti exist in its absence: light differences in colour reveal the hidden writings on the walls. There is clearly no space
for free expression in the streets. You are supposed to behave and if you don’t you
will be punished. The entrance to the metro has gates where you can pass freely,
as long as you show a ticket. If you don’t follow the rules with a valid ticket, the
gate will crush you from both sides. That’s how the system works. The fear for
being crushed keeps most people in track.
There are little cracks in the system. Not everyone is leaving public space as a
sphere of total control. After the presidential elections last spring where president
Lukashenko stayed at power, demonstrations were held. They were violently
oppressed and the public squares were empty again. Now other tactics are used:
flash mobs. By SMS, email and word of mouth people find out about the next
action. At a certain time and place they gather, do a small action and leave again.
Actions only take a few minutes, mostly too short time to interfere. Reading out
the constitution loud in front of the KGB building. Bringing candlelights to a
certain spot. Holding hands on a bridge. Nothing harmful, hard to catch, a silent
protest. Just for a few minutes the street can be yours. Even in a commercialised
dictatorship.
