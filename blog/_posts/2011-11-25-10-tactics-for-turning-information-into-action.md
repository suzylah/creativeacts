<p>&nbsp;</p><p>10 Tactics – for turning information into action is a toolkit for info-activism; it includes a documentary film, presenting the tactics and material for learning more. The film shows rights advocates from different countries working on grass root level with human rights issues. The film was shot in 2009, and it sheds light on many of the issues that reached mainstream media with the wave of protests in 2011.</p><p>The film is a good discussion opener in groups that work with human rights and new media. It gives ideas about actions that can be done, but warns also about taking care about the people that participate. The film and educational material about the 10 Tactics are creative commons licensed, so anyone can set up a film screening. The film can be downloaded from:&nbsp;<a avglsprocessed="1" href="http://www.informationactivism.org/" target="_blank">http://www.<wbr>informationactivism.org</a></p><p><wbr></p><p><wbr></p><wbr><p><wbr></p><wbr><wbr><p><wbr></p><wbr><wbr><wbr><p><wbr><wbr><wbr></p><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr><p><!--break--></p><p>I arranged an event about info-arcivism in Espoo, Finland.
