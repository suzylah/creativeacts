The "streetart" was discovered on the 24th of june and it stated: <strong>“Park Chung Hee and Kim Jong Il are both dictators; Park Chung Hee a dictator who developed his country’s economy, Kim Jong Il a dictator who starved people to death.”</strong></p><p>A natural reaction to the streetart is in North Korea appearantly locking down a city <strong>“In order to catch the culprit, regulations and inspections targeting visitors to Pyongyang as well as the city’s citizens went on for three days, until the morning of the 27th,”</strong> the source said. Propably it didn't hurt the economy, "you can't break what you don't have", I always think.</p><p>Hopefully they haven't cought and will never catch this rebel,<strong> this person got BALLS</strong> (yes, bolded and with CapsLock on)<!--break--></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
