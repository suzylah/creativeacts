Taking into account the fact that transport industry is one of the greatest contributors to the environmental pollution (in Sweden it makes 40% from the whole amount of poisonous emissions), organisation <a href="http://planka.nu">planka.nu</a> has calculated that it&#39;s cheeper to have free public transport. Only with unsignificant growth of taxes its possible to reduce the mankind contribution to the environment at the same time ensuring free public transport and developed bicycle infrastructure in the cities.

By inviting to join the world wide action FREE PUBLIC TRANSPORT DAY on the 5th of May (<a href="http://freepublictransportday.com">http://freepublictransportday.com</a>), <a href="http://planka.nu">planka.nu</a> invtes to stand up for development of railwayinfrastructure, cars-free city centres as well as socially-responsible and sustainable transport systems!
