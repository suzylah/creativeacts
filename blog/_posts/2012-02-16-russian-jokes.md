Some people are making Monty Python-esque banners that seem to have no common sense at all, while others are using recent online mems and old Russian folklore heroes. Sometimes Vladimir Putin accidentally generates mems of his own which then transform into drawings or inscriptions at the meetings. Once he determined the protesters as Bandar Logs which immediately generated jokes about him as Kaa. White paper stripes and unrolled condoms are not that easy to be confused, you know. However, Russian prime minister managed to do it. His vulgar joke generated numerous mems in response. Below are several examples of this brand new ‘protestainment’ trend.</p><p><!--break--><img alt="" src="/assets/files/u27/1.jpg"></p><p>‘We’re for fair amphorae’ – this slogan quotes Putin’s visit to Russian South when he heroically found two Greek amphorae in completely perfect state at an archaeological site. He’s damn lucky!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/files/u27/2.jpg"></p><p>Putler Kaput.
