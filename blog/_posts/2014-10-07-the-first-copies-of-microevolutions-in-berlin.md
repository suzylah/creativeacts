On the 20th of September, the first bookbinding event in Berlin took place, were visitors of the festival Recycled Creativity were invited to make their own copies of Microevolutions - a practical guide to creative activism. With great help from <a href="http://kartonverlag.wordpress.com/">Kartonverlag</a> we discovered how to bind books, and we are getting prepared to do it again! For you who want to make your own copy of Microevolutions - be sure to save the date 1st of November!

This project was made possible with help of financial support from the Youth in Action programme, now known as the Erasmus+ program.
