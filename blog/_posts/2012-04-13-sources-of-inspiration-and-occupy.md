Now and again we manage to break out into a global or national discussion, and that is the moment where we need to act. The occupy movement have changed the political landscape in the sense that it has managed to change the mainstream media story from one of attacking poor people, to one focused on the bankers."</span></div><div class="ace-line"><!--break--></div><div class="ace-line">&nbsp;</div><div class="ace-line" id="magicdomid1072"><span class="author-g-ccgsxytaru7sohtr">T.

They took ideas from the past, for example, the climate camp camping at power stations, and they moved that concept into the city. The climate camps in England have been very effective with getting their message across.

The fact that they stayed for two, three months is quite impressive. I think they have lost a little bit energy now, and they rethink and say: "OK, now we need to change". Politics is engaging and we have to use our creative energies to engage others in new forms. It is the desire of artists and designers to use their skills creatively in political situations. It is possible to highlight quite complex issues by using creative means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class="ace-line" id="magicdomid13"><span class="author-g-ccgsxytaru7sohtr">What is happening now In London, is that the Occupy movement are going more down to a grassroute level.

C.: "I think it has a lot to do with the media they use – all this Facebook, Twitter and others.&nbsp; I think it confirms the idea of just involving people who have never been out and done it. I have tweeted it, so I have done it. And I think that's the way for 99% of tweets. And I think that's the problem of the modern social media – it takes away the engagement from you. For example, if You do something like indymedia, or media camp, there way you have to get involved and do it demands an amount of things You have to do, producing audio, radio interviews, You are doing video interviews, You are doing print newspapers, blogging and all these things. An that forces You to think in different ways.</span></div><div class="ace-line" id="magicdomid1060"><span class="author-g-ccgsxytaru7sohtr">The ease of which the modern technology works actually tempts people not to do that – I have seen it how it works with </span><span class="author-g-ccgsxytaru7sohtr padtag padtag_occupy"><a href="http://piratepad.net/ep/search?query=occupy">#occupy</a></span><span class="author-g-ccgsxytaru7sohtr"> movement – they just tweet something out and thing that they have dealt with that issue, that they have done it.&nbsp; But what I say is – no, You haven't done it, all You have done is tweeted and lot of people have read Your two sentences.
