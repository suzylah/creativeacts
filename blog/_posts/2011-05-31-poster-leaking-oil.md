By the way,they hate oil in general. They thought it was about enough with oil-spills by oil-tankers and set up<a href="http://dogwoodinitiative.org/notankers" target="_blank"> a campaign to bann them from the seas</a>. Therefor they pasted around some cool posters, without any text.</p><p>Because who needs arguments when you have a cool concept?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
