It is created by VR/Urban - a collective of public media inverntionistas, working together to create public media realtime installations. <!--break-->It is equipped with an ultra-high frequency radio, hacked micro processor board, a laser-pointer and batteries. A text messages can be typed on a phone-sized wooden keypad which is integrated in the also wooden slingshot. After the message is finished, people can aim on a media facade and send/shoot the message straight to the targeted point. It will then appear as a colour splash with the message written within. The text message will also be real-time twittered to link up real and virtual worlds. More information at: http://www.vrurban.org/</p>
