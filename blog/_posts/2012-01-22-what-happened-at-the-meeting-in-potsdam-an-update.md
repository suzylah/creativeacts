<p>It was quite necesairy since <strong>Masta, until now, never had a general meeting</strong> of everybody involved in the different crews that people work in. The many people know eighother from seminars and exchanges but never met all together <strong>for the purpose of streamlining the entire Masta organisation</strong>.</p><p>On thursdayevening, the first day, we started arriving at the projecthouse in Potsdam. While waiting for the others, those who had arrived made a timeline with <strong>Masta-memories thru history</strong>. Some of us had been there <strong>since the beginning at Loesje</strong>, some joined on the way and were there when Masta split off and others had just arrived in the project. Each having their own reasons to join but <strong>all just as much part of the family</strong>.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/files/u6/History%20timeline.JPG" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; width: 914px; height: 155px; "></p><p>After this creative evening, drinks and catching up we started what we came for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
