<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Berlin Zoo Lion King Takes Steps against Insolent Disruption of His Royal Privacy</strong></p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/files/u8/loewe.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 350px; height: 233px; "></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike hysterical breakdowns of more lowly creatures at the Zoo, The King's actions and measures are controlled, extroverted, efficient, and almost noble. In fact, this is the first time in the Berlin Zoo's history that an animal achieved its aims so rapidly and by implementing a somewhat diplomatic solution.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only do the bewildered visitors not dare to bother the Sovereign by approaching his private chambers, but also insiders have elevated him to the level of a true creative activist - meanwhile His obedient servants from the Zoo have even perpetuated the Monarch's Will on a red sign juxtaposed to his kingly cage that reads: <em><strong>"Careful, lion spouts urine through the bars."</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><!--break--></p>
