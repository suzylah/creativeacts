<p>Trying to define MAŠTA magazine</p><p>A working group of people, who are enthusiastic to work for MAŠTA community (<a href="http://mastazine.net">http://mastazine.net</a>) as editors for magazine, came together to discuss the identity of he project and came up with such statement:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Mašta is a platform to report on innovative ways to address social-political problems and to inspire creative forces for social change. Mašta stands for creative freedom to transcend dreams into action in order to aid innovative solutions. We call it creative activism.<br />Mašta invites you and everybody to find and report new creative ways to act in society&#39;s public space. Mašta means whatever and imagination, and wants to inspire people to accomplish whatever they imagine is possible.</em></p>
