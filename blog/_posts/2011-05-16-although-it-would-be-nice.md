<p><img alt="" src="/assets/files/u6/medium_IMG_1719.JPG" style="WIDTH: 301px; HEIGHT: 301px">&nbsp;But ... <a href="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_liwkvptGMg1qiup77o1_500.jpg" target="_blank">We are trying</a>.</p><p>Well, trying? Not really but it would be nice if it wouldn't be necesairy to expres this. Anyhow, it is a very nice banner. Inspired by a sticker that you might have seen hanging around somewhere. This picture is taken on an anti-policeviolence manifestation in Utrecht. It was organised after a may 1st <a href="http://papparazi.noblogs.org/post/2011/05/02/photos-1st-of-may-2011-utrecht/" target="_blank">demonstration got messed up</a> by violent police intervention even before the demonstration had started. Of barely 200 people, 15 got arrested of which 2 had to be taken to the hospital (dislocated elbow and a brain-injury). A couple others where treated for concussions.</p><p>Okay, enough of this frustrated anti-police language. A bit more about the banner.</p><p>Not that it's so special but I really liked it. Just a round piece of fabric hold straight by a long piece of PVC-pipe (with what you can't even smack the riot-cops with but I gues that's the whole purpose of it). Due to the pink, gold and the heart, as if a <a href="http://www.bilerico.com/2010/06/NotGay_Queer1-thumb-200x266-11735.jpg" target="_blank">gay-ass</a> banner would make the message less provocative, it is soaked with sarcasm. But at the same these very same things soften the message to a public friendly format.</p><p>After the manifestation that went well as planned, the police stated that they felt very provoced. This makes me wonder what would have happened if this banner had been red and black?</p>
