In the end of April an important event for creative activists happened in Moskow – conference of urban activism, 4th edition of “Delay Sammit”! Main topics for this year were: community work, high technologies in activism, protection of public interests and self-organisation.

Within two days of the weekend more than 30 theoretical and another dozen of practical workshops were available. Apart from this diverse interaction with theorists and activists from all over the world, there happened an exhibition of high-technological activism “Future of DIY-activism” curated by Alen Biber, author of the blog <a href="http://www.rebelart.net">http://www.rebelart.net</a>

Projects are about mass surveillance, free internet-culture, mass media manipulations and ways activists invent to oppose all that. Works of the exhibition imply critical approach of the new generation of artists, designers and hakers towards development of engineering systems on which we count more and more everyday.

Either you challenge the IT age or it challenges you, have a look and keep on with Time!

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">CV Dazzle explores how fashion can be used as camouflage from face-detection technology, the first step in automated face recognition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The name is derived from a type of World War I naval camouflage called Dazzle, which used cubist-inspired designs to break apart the visual continuity of a battleship and conceal its orientation and size. Likewise, CV Dazzle uses avant-garde hairstyling and makeup designs to break apart the continuity of a face. Since facial-recognition algorithms rely on the identification and spatial relationship of key facial features, like symmetry and tonal contours, one can block detection by creating an “anti-face”.</p>

<p>Your TV-B-Gone universal remote control resembles other TV remote controls, but is different in two important ways. First, it only has a power button that allows you to switch a TV on or off. You control when you see, rather than what you see. Second, the device is so small that it easily fits in your pocket, so that you have it handy whenever you need it wherever you go: airports, bars, restaurants, laundromats, etc.</p>
