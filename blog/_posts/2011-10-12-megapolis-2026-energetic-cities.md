<p>Energy often seems like a distant topic, despite the fact that energy issues are present in our everyday lives: in how we eat, in how we move and in what charges our mobile phones. Still the world is full of examples of sustainable energy production, low energy living and low carbon transport solutions. The Megapolis 2026 festival offers inspiring and energetic insights into future energy solutions.</p><p><img alt="megapolis, alternative energy, festival" src="http://megapolis2026.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/featured_tarrat2.png" style="width: 400px; height: 150px; float: left;">Megapolis 2026 Energetic cities is an urban festival which looks for urban solutions to environmental problems.
